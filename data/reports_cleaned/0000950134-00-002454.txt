COMPETITION Most major air carriers developed hub-and-spoke systems schedule patterns effort maximize revenue potential service. American operates hubs: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O'Hare, Miami San Juan, Puerto Rico. Delta Air Lines United Airlines hub operations DFW Chicago O'Hare, respectively. 1 <PAGE> 3 The American Eagle carriers increase number markets Company serves providing connections American American's hubs major airports. The American Eagle carriers serve smaller markets Boston, DFW, Chicago, Miami, San Juan, Los Angeles New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. American's competitors marketing agreements regional carriers provide similar services major hubs. In addition extensive domestic service, Company international service Caribbean, Canada, Latin America, Europe Pacific. The Company's operating revenues foreign operations approximately $5.2 billion 1999, $5.3 billion 1998 $5.2 billion 1997. Additional information Company's foreign operations included Note 13 consolidated financial statements. The domestic airline industry fiercely competitive. Currently, carrier deemed fit U.S. Department Transportation (DOT) free operate scheduled passenger service points U.S. possessions. On domestic non-stop routes, Company faces competing service one, one, major domestic airline including: America West Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways affiliated regional carriers. Competition greater cities require connection, airlines compete respective hubs. The Company competes national, regional, all-cargo, charter carriers and, shorter segments, ground transportation. On routes, pricing decisions affected, part, competition airlines, cost structures significantly lower American's operate profitably lower fare levels. As December 31, 1999, approximately 56 percent American's bookings impacted competition low-cost carriers. The majority tickets travel American American Eagle sold travel agents. Domestic travel agents generally receive base commission percent price tickets sell. This amount capped maximum $50 domestic roundtrip itinerary $100 international roundtrip itinerary. Airlines pay additional commissions connection special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete respect price tickets sold respect amount commissions paid. The growing electronic distribution systems Company ever-increasing ability lower distribution costs.

In providing international air transportation, American competes foreign investor-owned carriers, state-owned carriers U.S. airlines granted authority provide scheduled passenger cargo service U.S. overseas locations. American's operating authority markets subject aviation agreements U.S. respective countries, cases, fares schedules require approval and/or relevant foreign governments. Because international air transportation governed bilateral agreements U.S. foreign country countries involved, U.S. foreign government aviation policies result alteration termination agreements, diminish route authorities, adversely affect American's international operations. Bilateral agreements U.S. foreign countries served American subject frequent renegotiation. In addition, foreign airports, carrier slots (landing take-off authorizations) carrier introduce service increase existing service. The availability slots assured inhibit carrier's efforts compete markets. 2 <PAGE> 4 The major U.S. carriers advantage foreign competitors ability generate traffic extensive domestic route systems. In cases, however, foreign governments, subsidize American's foreign competitors, limit U.S. carriers' rights carry passengers designated gateway cities foreign countries. To improve access other's markets, U.S. foreign carriers -- including American -- established marketing relationships airlines. American code-sharing programs Air Pacific, Alaska Airlines, Asiana, Canadian, Eastern Airlines, EVA, Finnair, TACA Group, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Airlines, LanChile, LOT Polish Airlines, Qantas Airways, Sabena, SNCF, Swissair Group.

In addition, Company expects implement expand alliances international carriers, including Aeropostal, Aer Lingus, Avianca, Aerolineas Argentinas, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways Turkish Airlines, pending regulatory approval. In coming years, Company expects develop programs evaluate alliances international carriers. In February 1999, American, British Airways, Canadian, Cathay Pacific Airways Qantas Airways formed global alliance ONEworldTM. In September 1999, founding members joined Finnair Iberia. The ONEworld alliance links networks member carriers enhance customer service smooth connections destinations served alliance, including linking carriers' frequent flyer programs access carriers' airport lounge facilities. Following acquisition Canadian Air Canada, Canadian terminate membership oneworld June 2000. Also June 2000, Aer Lingus LanChile join ONEworld alliance. In December 1999, American reached comprehensive agreement Canadian Air Canada resolve outstanding issues arising Air Canada's acquisition Canadian. Under agreement, American continue codeshare Canadian ten years, long Canadian brand remains existence. Should Canadian absorbed fully Air Canada ten-year period, American allowed place code Air Canada services replaced services operated Canadian prior acquisition Air Canada. The Company believes advantages relative competition. Its fleet efficient quiet, youngest fleets U.S. airline industry. It comprehensive domestic international route structure, anchored efficient hubs, permit full advantage traffic growth occurs. The Company believes American's AAdvantage frequent flyer program, largest program industry, superior service give competitive advantage. In addition, February 2000, Company announced program - "More Room Throughout Coach" - provide room passengers coach cabins. American's entire fleet reconfigured increase seat pitch 75,000 coach seats, increasing seat pitch present industry standard 31 32 inches predominant seat pitch 34 35 inches. The Company believes providing greater comfort coach cabin, achieve competitive advantage competition. REGULATION GENERAL The Airline Deregulation Act 1978, amended, eliminated domestic economic regulation passenger freight transportation. However, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority air carriers. The maintains jurisdiction approval international codeshare agreements, international route authorities consumer protection matters, advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability computer reservations systems. The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing personnel, aircraft security standards. As part oversight, FAA implemented number requirements American incorporating maintenance program. These matters relate to, things, inspection maintenance aging aircraft, corrosion control, installation upgraded digital flight data recorders, enhanced ground proximity warning systems cargo compartment smoke detection fire suppression systems. Based current implementation schedule, American expects compliance applicable requirements required time periods. 3 <PAGE> 5 The U.S. Department Justice jurisdiction airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service jurisdiction aspects transportation mail related services. Labor relations air transportation industry regulated Railway Labor Act, vests National Mediation Board regulatory functions respect disputes airlines labor unions relating union representation collective bargaining agreements. To extent American continues increase alliances international carriers, American subject regulations foreign agencies. The Department Justice investigating competitive practices major carriers major hub airports, including American's practices DFW (for information, Item 3. Legal Proceedings). Also, April 1998, issued proposed pricing capacity rules severely limit major carriers' ability compete entrant carriers. The outcomes investigations proposed rules unknown. However, extent (i) restrictions imposed American's ability respond competitor, (ii) competitors advantage federal assistance, American's business adversely impacted. AIRLINE FARES Airlines permitted establish domestic fares governmental regulation, industry characterized substantial price competition. The maintains authority international fares, rates charges. International fares rates subject jurisdiction governments foreign countries American serves. While air carriers required file adhere international fare rate tariffs, substantial commissions, overrides discounts travel agents, brokers wholesalers characterize international markets. Legislation (sometimes referred "Passengers' Bill Rights") discussed legislatures, including Congress. This legislation would, enacted, (i) place limitations airline fares and/or (ii) affect operating practices baggage handling overbooking. To extent legislation enacted inhibit American's flexibility respect fares, revenue management system aspects customer service operations, American's financial results adversely affected. Effective December 15, 1999, Company, domestic airlines, implemented Customer Service Plan address number service goals, including, limited (i) lowest fare availability, (ii) delays, cancellations, diversion events, (iii) baggage delivery liability, (iv) guaranteed fares, (v) ticket refunds, (vi) accommodation customers special needs, (vii) essential customer extraordinary delays, (viii) flight oversales, (ix) Frequent Flyer Program - AAdvantage, (x) travel policies, (xi) service domestic code share partners, (xii) handling customer issues. Fare discounting competitors historically negative effect Company's financial results Company generally required match competitors' fares maintain passenger traffic. During recent years, number low-cost airlines entered domestic market major airlines, including American, implemented efforts lower cost structures. Further fare reductions, domestic international, occur future. If fare reductions offset increases passenger traffic, cost reductions mix traffic improves yields, Company's operating results negatively impacted. AIRPORT ACCESS In 1968, FAA issued rule designating New York John F. Kennedy, New York LaGuardia, Washington Reagan, Chicago O'Hare Newark airports high density traffic airports. Newark subsequently removed high density airport classification. The rule limits number Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations - take-offs landings - permitted hour requires slot support operation. Recently, legislation passed Congress eliminate slots Chicago O'Hare 2002 New York's John F. Kennedy LaGuardia airports 2007. The Company evaluating impact, any, elimination slots Company's operations financial condition results operations. At December 31, 1999, net book Company's slots New York John F. Kennedy, New York LaGuardia Chicago O'Hare airports approximately $160 million. Currently, FAA permits purchasing, selling (except designated international essential air service), leasing, transferring trading slots airlines others, subject restrictions. Most foreign airports, including London Heathrow, major European destination American, slot allocations. Most foreign authorities permit purchasing, selling leasing slots. 4 <PAGE> 6 Although Company constrained slots, sufficient slot authorizations operate existing flights generally obtain slots expand operations change schedules. However, assurance American American Eagle obtain slots purposes future because, factors, slot allocations subject government policies. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company subject laws government regulations environmental matters employee safety health U.S. countries. U.S. federal laws impact Company include Airport Noise Capacity Act 1990 (ANCA), Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation Recovery Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act (CERCLA Superfund Act). The Company subject oversight Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) employee safety health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, federal agencies authorized promulgate regulations impact Company's operations. In addition federal activities, states delegated authorities aforementioned federal statutes. Many state local governments adopted environmental employee safety health laws regulations, similar federal requirements. As part continuing safety, health environmental program, Company anticipates comply requirements material adverse effect business. For purposes noise standards, jet aircraft rated categories "stages." The ANCA required phase-out December 31, 1999, Stage aircraft operations, subject exceptions. Under final regulations issued FAA 1991, air carriers required reduce, modification retirement, number Stage aircraft fleets 75 percent December 31, 1998 100 percent December 31, 1999. Alternatively, carrier satisfied regulations operating fleet 75 percent 100 percent Stage dates set preceding sentence, respectively. At December 31, 1999, American's active fleet Stage III, quietest rating category. The ANCA recognizes rights airport operators noise problems implement local noise abatement programs long interfere unreasonably interstate foreign commerce national air transportation system. Authorities cities promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including imposition nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval local noise restrictions Stage aircraft effective October 1990, establishes regulatory notice review process local restrictions Stage aircraft proposed October 1990. While American sufficient scheduling flexibility accommodate local noise restrictions imposed date, American's operations adversely affected locally-imposed regulations restrictive widespread. American identified EPA potentially responsible party (PRP) Operating Industries, Inc. Superfund Site California. American signed partial consent decree respect site PRPs named. American identified PRP Beede Waste Oil Superfund Site New Hampshire. American responded 104(e) Request Information interaction companies related site. At Operating Industries, Inc. Beede Waste Oil sites, American's alleged waste disposal volumes minor compared PRPs sites. In 1998, EPA named American de minimis PRP Casmalia Waste Disposal Site California. American, tenants San Francisco International Airport (SFIA), ordered California Regional Water Quality Control Board engage studies potential environmental contamination airport undertake remedial measures, necessary. SFIA seeking recover past costs related contamination tenants. 5 <PAGE> 7 The Miami International Airport Authority remediating environmental conditions Miami International Airport (the Airport) funding remediation costs landing fee revenues. Future costs remediation effort borne carriers operating Airport, including American, increased landing fees and/or charges PRPs longer business. The future increase landing fees and/or charges material estimated due factors, including unknown extent remedial actions required, proportion cost ultimately recovered responsible parties, uncertainties environmental agencies ultimately supervise remedial activities nature supervision. In 1999, American ordered New York State Department Environmental Conservation conduct remediation environmental contamination located Terminals 8 9 New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. American seeking recover portion related costs previous users premises. Also 1999, Company entered plea agreement United States government respect count indictment relating storage hazardous materials. As part plea agreement, Company probation years adopted comprehensive compliance program. To extent Company fails abide terms probation compliance program, Company's operations adversely impacted. American Executive Airlines, Inc., tenants Luis Munoz Marin International Airport San Juan, Puerto Rico, named PRPs environmental claims airport. American Eagle Airlines, Inc. notified potential liability New York law inactive hazardous waste site Poughkeepsie, New York. AMR expect matters, individually collectively, material impact financial position liquidity. LABOR The airline business labor intensive. Wages, salaries benefits represented approximately 37 percent AMR's consolidated operating expenses year ended December 31, 1999. The majority American's employees represented labor unions covered collective bargaining agreements. American's relations labor organizations governed Railway Labor Act. Under act, collective bargaining agreements American organizations expire amendable stated date. If party wishes modify terms agreement, notify party manner agreement. After receipt notice, parties meet direct negotiations, agreement reached, party request National Mediation Board (NMB) appoint federal mediator. If agreement reached mediation, NMB determine, time, impasse exists, impasse declared, NMB proffers binding arbitration parties. Either party decline submit arbitration. If arbitration rejected, 30-day "cooling-off" period commences, labor organization strike airline resort "self-help," including imposition proposed amendments hiring workers replace strikers. In 1995, American reached agreements members Association Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) Transport Workers Union (TWU) labor contracts. American's collective bargaining agreement APFA amendable November 1, 1998 collective bargaining agreement TWU amendable March 1, 2001. American exchanged proposals commenced negotiations APFA September 2, 1998. The parties reached tentative agreement mid-1999 membership subsequently ratify. Direct negotiations continue. American's current collective bargaining agreement Allied Pilots Association (APA) ratified APA membership May 5, 1997. That contract amendable August 31, 2001. 6 <PAGE> 8 In early February 1999, members APA engaged activities (increased sick time declining fly additional trips) resulted numerous cancellations American's system. These actions response acquisition Reno Air December 1998. On February 10, 1999, American obtained temporary restraining order prohibiting union unilaterally taking actions violation Railway Labor Act. Because continuing actions APA leaders entry temporary restraining order, American filed motion APA leaders held contempt court's temporary restraining order. The court granted motion February 13, 1999, airline's operations returned normal. The Company APA subsequently agreed method combining Reno pilot workforce American. The parties engaged discussions issues effort improve relationship, includes extension existing APA contract. The Communications Workers America (CWA) filed petition NMB October 8, 1998, seeking represent American's passenger service employees, represented. The mail ballots election conducted NMB counted December 15, 1998. Forty-one percent employees voted unionize, short 50 percent needed unionization occur.

If parties unable agree limited changes, agreed issues resolved interest arbitration, exercise self-help (such strike). The Association Flight Attendants (AFA), represents flight attendants Eagle carriers, reached agreement AMR Eagle effective March 2, 1998, flight attendants AMR Eagle carriers covered single contract. The agreement amendable September 2, 2002. The union employees AMR Eagle carriers covered separate agreements TWU effective April 28, 1998, amendable April 28, 2003. FUEL The Company's operations significantly affected availability price jet fuel. American's fuel costs consumption years 1997 1999 were: <TABLE> <CAPTION> Average Cost Per Gallon, Percent Gallons Average Cost Excluding AMR's Consumed Total Cost Per Gallon Fuel Taxes Operating Year (in millions) (in millions) (in cents) (in cents) Expenses --------------- ----------------- ------------------ ---------------- ------------- --------------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> 1997 2,773 $ 1,860 67.1 62.1 12.1 1998 2,826 1,551 54.9 50.1 10.0 1999 2,957 1,622 54.8 50.1 9.8 </TABLE> 7 <PAGE> 9 The impact fuel price Company competitors dependent factors, including hedging strategies. Although American's average cost gallon fuel 1999 flat comparison 1998, actual fuel prices began increase April 1999 continued significantly 1999 2000. However, American fuel hedging program enters fuel swap option contracts protect increases jet fuel prices, effect dampening American's average cost gallon. To reduce impact potential continuing fuel price increases 2000, American hedged approximately 48 percent 2000 fuel requirements December 31, 1999. Based projected fuel usage, American estimates 10 percent increase price gallon fuel result increase aircraft fuel expense approximately $125 million 2000, net fuel hedge instruments outstanding December 31, 1999. Due competitive nature airline industry, event continuing increases price jet fuel, assurance American pass increased fuel prices customers increasing fares. Likewise, potential benefit lower fuel prices offset increased fare competition lower revenues air carriers. While American anticipate significant reduction fuel availability, dependency foreign imports crude oil possibility government policy jet fuel production, transportation marketing make impossible predict future availability jet fuel. If major reductions availability jet fuel, American's business adversely affected. Additional information Company's fuel program included Outlook 2000, Item 7(A) - Quantitative Qualitative Disclosures Market Risk, Note 6 consolidated financial statements. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM American established AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) develop passenger loyalty offering awards travelers continued patronage. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits flights American, American Eagle participating airlines, utilizing services program participants, including hotels, car rental companies bank credit card issuers. American sells mileage credits related services companies participating program. American reserves change AAdvantage program rules, regulations, travel awards special offers time notice. American initiate impacting, example, participant affiliations, rules earning mileage credit, mileage levels awards, blackout dates limited seating travel awards, features special offers. American reserves end AAdvantage program months' notice. Mileage credits redeemed free, discounted upgraded travel American, American Eagle participating airlines, travel industry awards. Once member accrues sufficient mileage award, member request award certificate American. Award certificates redeemed year issuance. Most travel awards subject blackout dates capacity controlled seating. In 1999, made AAdvantage program miles expire, provided customer type qualifying activity 36 months. American accounts frequent flyer obligation accrual basis incremental cost method. American's frequent flyer liability accrued time member accumulates sufficient mileage account claim lowest level free travel award (25,000 miles) award expected free travel. American includes fuel, food, reservations/ticketing costs, contribution overhead profit, calculation incremental cost. The cost fuel estimated based total fuel consumption tracked categories markets, amount allocated passenger. Food costs tracked market category, amount allocated passenger. Reservation/ticketing costs based total number passengers, including traveling free awards, divided American's total expense costs. American defers portion revenues received companies participating AAdvantage program related sale mileage credits recognizes revenues period approximating period mileage credits used. 8 <PAGE> 10 At December 31, 1999 1998, American estimated approximately 5.4 million 4.9 million free travel awards, respectively, expected redeemed free travel American. In making estimate free travel awards, American excluded mileage inactive accounts, mileage related accounts reached lowest level free travel award, mileage active accounts reached lowest level free travel award expected redeemed free travel American. The liability program mileage reached lowest level free travel award expected redeemed free travel American participating airlines deferred revenues mileage credits sold participating program $827 million $695 million, representing 14.1 percent 13.1 percent AMR's total current liabilities, December 31, 1999 1998, respectively.

Further, May 1998, Continental Airlines Continental Express filed lawsuit Dallas federal court seeking judicial declaration Bond Ordinance enforced prevent operating flights Love Field Cleveland regional jets. These federal court lawsuits consolidated stayed. In December 1998, Department Transportation (DOT) issued order federal law questions Bond Ordinance, local proprietary powers, DFW's Use Agreement DFW carriers American, Wright 1997 Amendments, concluded Bond Ordinance preempted federal law enforceable. The found DFW Use Agreement preclude American conducting interstate operations Love Field. Fort Worth, American DFW appealed DOT's order Fifth Circuit Court Appeals, February 1, 2000, Fifth Circuit affirmed DOT's order respects. In January 2000, Department Justice, behest DOT, filed lawsuit United States District Court Northern District Texas, Dallas Division, Fort Worth American seeking enforce DOT's order prevent party interfering carrier operating order. American announced service Love Field beginning May 1, 2000, Chicago Los Angeles seeking facilities Love Field Dallas. As result foregoing, future interstate flight operations Love Field American's DFW hub uncertain. An increase operations Love Field interstate destinations adversely impact American's business. OUTLOOK 2000 The Company cautiously optimistic 2000 revenue environment. The U.S. economy remains strong, world's economies expected continue improve. Against backdrop, chief concerns industry's ability match capacity growth demand air travel, higher fuel prices. For American, capacity expected increase slightly 2000. The increase American's seating capacity delivery aircraft offset removal approximately 7,200 seats fleet. (In February 2000, Company announced "More Room Throughout Coach" initiative, provide room passengers coach cabins. American's entire fleet reconfigured increase seat pitch present industry standard 31 32 inches predominant seat pitch 34 35 inches.) Over year, Company expects strengthen position key domestic markets, strategically expanding international network. Domestically, American AMR Eagle continue benefit integration Reno Business Express, marketing relationships U.S. Airways, Inc. Alaska Airlines, Inc. Internationally, American introduce minimal service increases, will, appropriate, expand code-share alliances. Further, ONEworld admit partners 2000 -- LanChile Aer Lingus -- and, losing Canadian Airlines, buttress position Canada. 22 <PAGE> 24 Pressure reduce costs continue, volatility fuel prices makes prediction costs difficult. Excluding fuel, Company anticipates increase operating expenses percent, driven primarily higher labor costs normal seniority scale increases union contracts, increase depreciation amortization expense maintenance, materials repairs expense Company continues acquire aircraft, increase airport landing fees facility rent expense higher rates. Other expense lines volume-driven increases inflationary pressures. Partially offsetting expected increase costs, Company expects savings commission expense due made late 1999 commission structure, decrease percentage commissionable transactions. Overshadowing expenses, though, expected increase fuel expense, owing significantly higher fuel prices. Although Company hedged approximately 48 percent 2000 fuel requirements December 31, 1999, 2000 earnings adversely impacted significant rise fuel prices. The magnitude impact driven duration higher prices, which, minimum, dampen Company's half 2000 financial results. In addition direct effect, higher fuel prices may, sustained current levels extended period time, indirectly negatively impact Company slowing economy demand air travel.
