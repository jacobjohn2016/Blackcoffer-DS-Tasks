As such, Sabre treated discontinued operation Item 6 - Selected Consolidated Financial Data, Item 7 - - Management's Discussion Analysis Financial Condition Results Operations Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, discussion Other Items Form 10-K relates primarily American AMR Eagle. On September 11, 2001, American Airlines aircraft hijacked destroyed terrorist attacks The World Trade Center New York City Pentagon northern Virginia. On day, United Air Lines (United) aircraft hijacked terrorist attacks. In addition loss life board aircraft, attacks resulted untold deaths injuries persons ground massive property damage. In response terrorist attacks, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued federal ground stop order September 11, 2001, prohibiting flights to, from, United States. Airports reopen September 13, 2001 (except Washington Reagan Airport, partially reopened October 4, 2001). The Company operate portion scheduled flights days thereafter. When flights permitted resume, passenger traffic yields Company's flights significantly lower prior attacks. As result, Company reduced operating schedule approximately 80 percent schedule flew prior September 11, 2001. In addition, result schedule reduction sharp fall passenger traffic, Company eliminated approximately 20,000 jobs. The Company's future schedule vary Company reacts continuing demand yields, normal factors seasonality fleet composition. 1 <PAGE> On September 22, 2001, President Bush signed law Air Transportation Safety System Stabilization Act (the Act), U.S. airlines air cargo carriers (collectively, air carriers) for, things: (i) $5 billion compensation direct losses (including lost revenues) incurred result federal ground stop order incremental losses incurred December 31, 2001 direct result attacks, Company received approximately $728 million December 31, 2001 expects receive additional payments 2002 aggregating approximately $128 million; (ii) subject conditions, availability $10 billion federal government guarantees loans made air carriers credit determined newly established Air Transportation Stabilization Board; (iii) authority Secretary Transportation reimburse air carriers (which authority expires 180 days enactment Act) increase cost insurance, coverage ending October 1, 2002, premium effect period September 4, 2001 September 10, 2001; (iv) discretion Secretary Transportation, $100 million limit liability air carrier parties respect acts terrorism committed air carrier 180-day period enactment Act; (v) extension due date payment air carriers excise taxes; (vi) compensation individual claimants physically injured killed result terrorist attacks September 11, 2001.

On November 12, 2001, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed shortly take-off John F. Kennedy International Airport en route Santo Domingo Dominican Republic. In addition loss life board aircraft, fatalities injuries persons ground property damage. The National Transportation Safety Board investigating accident; determined. As result accident, claims made American. It anticipated claims covered American's insurance policies. COMPETITION Most major air carriers developed hub-and-spoke systems schedule patterns effort maximize revenue potential service. American operates hubs: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O'Hare, Miami, St. Louis San Juan, Puerto Rico. Delta Air Lines (Delta) United hub operations DFW Chicago O'Hare, respectively. The American Eagle carriers increase number markets Company serves providing connections American American's hubs major airports. The American Eagle carriers serve smaller markets Boston, DFW, Chicago, Miami, San Juan, Los Angeles New York's LaGuardia John F. Kennedy International Airports. In addition, American contracts independently owned regional airlines business "American Connection" provide connecting service American St. Louis. American's competitors marketing agreements regional carriers provide similar services major hubs. In addition extensive domestic service, Company international service Caribbean, Bahamas, Canada, Latin America, Europe Pacific. The Company's operating revenues foreign operations approximately 28 percent, 30 percent 29 percent Company's total operating revenues 2001, 2000 1999, respectively. Additional information Company's foreign operations included Note 15 consolidated financial statements. 2 <PAGE> The domestic airline industry fiercely competitive. Currently, air carrier deemed fit U.S. Department Transportation (DOT) free operate scheduled passenger service points U.S. possessions. On domestic non-stop routes, Company faces competing service one, one, major domestic airline including: Alaska Airlines, America West Airlines, Continental Airlines (Continental), Delta, Northwest Airlines (Northwest), Southwest Airlines, United US Airways, affiliated regional carriers. Competition greater cities require connection, major airlines compete respective hubs. The Company competes national, regional, all-cargo charter carriers and, shorter segments, ground transportation. In addition, routes, pricing decisions affected, part, competition airlines, cost structures significantly lower Company's operate profitably lower fare levels. The majority tickets travel American American Eagle sold travel agents. Domestic travel agents generally receive base commission percent price tickets sell. This amount capped Company maximum $20 domestic roundtrip itinerary $100 international roundtrip itinerary. Airlines pay additional commissions connection special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete respect price tickets sold respect amount commissions paid. The growing electronic distribution systems Company ever-increasing ability lower distribution costs. The Company continues expand capabilities Internet website - AA.com - electronic ticketing Company's network. In addition, Company entered agreements Internet travel providers, including Travelocity.com, Expedia, priceline.com, Orbitz Hotwire. The base commission sales Internet travel providers lower traditional travel agencies. International air transportation subject extensive government regulation. In providing international air transportation, Company competes foreign investor-owned carriers, state-owned carriers U.S. airlines granted authority provide scheduled passenger cargo service U.S. overseas locations. The Company's operating authority markets subject aviation agreements U.S. respective countries, cases, fares schedules require approval and/or relevant foreign governments. Because international air transportation governed bilateral agreements U.S. foreign country countries involved, U.S. foreign government aviation policies result alteration termination agreements, diminish route authorities, adversely affect Company's international operations. Bilateral agreements U.S. foreign countries served Company subject renegotiation. In addition, foreign airports, air carrier slots (landing take-off authorizations) air carrier introduce service increase existing service. The availability slots assured inhibit air carrier's efforts compete markets. The major U.S. air carriers advantage foreign competitors ability generate traffic extensive domestic route systems. In cases, however, foreign governments, subsidize Company's foreign competitors, limit U.S. air carriers' rights carry passengers designated gateway cities foreign countries. To improve access other's markets, U.S. foreign air carriers - including American - established marketing relationships airlines rail companies. American code-sharing programs Aer Lingus, Air Pacific, Alaska Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Eastern Airlines, Air, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Airlines, LanChile, LOT Polish Airlines, Qantas Airways, SNCF, TACA Group, Group, TAP Air Portugal, Thalys Turkish Airlines. American Eagle code-sharing programs Continental, Delta, Midwest Express Northwest, addition code-sharing American's codeshare partners. Certain relationships include reciprocity American airlines' frequent flyer programs. In addition, Company expects implement codeshares Cathay Pacific Airways Airlines pending regulatory approval. In coming years, Company expects develop programs evaluate alliances carriers. 3 <PAGE> In February 1999, American, British Airways, Canadian Airlines International Limited (Canadian), Cathay Pacific Airways Qantas Airways formed global alliance ONEworld(TM). In September 1999, Finnair Iberia joined founding members. Also, June 2000, Aer Lingus LanChile joined ONEworld alliance. Following acquisition Canadian Air Canada, Canadian terminated membership ONEworld June 2000. The ONEworld alliance links networks member carriers enhance customer service smooth connections destinations served alliance, including linking carriers' frequent flyer programs access carriers' airport lounge facilities. In August 2001, American entered comprehensive transatlantic alliance agreement British Airways subsequently filed antitrust immunity regulators U.S. Europe. In January 2002, issued preliminary "show cause" order outlining remedy requirements approval alliance. Shortly afterwards, American British Airways alliance forward conditions DOT. American British Airways subsequently filed motion withdraw joint application February 13, 2002; motion granted. American British Airways actively seeking develop bilateral cooperation enhance mutual ONEworld alliance extent permitted regulatory parameters. Several American's major competitors members marketing/operational alliances enjoy antitrust immunity. To extent American British Airways restricted relationship lack antitrust immunity, carriers competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis alliances. The Company believes advantages relative competition. It operates fleet efficient quiet. It comprehensive domestic international route structure, anchored efficient hubs, permit full advantage traffic growth occurs. The Company believes American's AAdvantage frequent flyer program, largest program industry, More Room Throughout Coach program superior service give competitive advantage. REGULATION GENERAL The Airline Deregulation Act 1978, amended, eliminated domestic economic regulation passenger freight transportation. However, FAA exercise regulatory authority air carriers. The maintains jurisdiction approval international codeshare agreements, international route authorities consumer protection matters, advertising, denied boarding compensation baggage liability. The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing personnel, aircraft security standards. As part oversight, FAA implemented number requirements Company incorporating maintenance programs. These matters relate to, things, enhanced ground proximity warning systems, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 metal-mylar insulation replacement, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 main landing gear piston improvements, Boeing 757 Boeing 767 pylon improvements, Boeing 737 elevator improvements Airbus A300 structural improvements. Based current implementation schedule, Company expects compliance applicable requirements required time periods. The DOJ jurisdiction airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service jurisdiction aspects transportation mail related services. Labor relations air transportation industry regulated Railway Labor Act, vests National Mediation Board (NMB) regulatory functions respect disputes airlines labor unions relating union representation collective bargaining agreements. To extent Company continues increase alliances international carriers, Company subject regulations foreign agencies. 4 <PAGE> In November 2001, Aviation Transportation Security Act (ATSA) enacted. The ATSA created government agency, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), part responsible aviation security. The ATSA mandates TSA provide screening passengers property, including U.S. mail, cargo, carry-on checked baggage, articles carried aboard passenger aircraft. The TSA assumed passenger screening functions February 2002, largely contracting private-sector security providers; however, November 2002, TSA required federal employees place perform functions. To comply checked baggage screening requirements, checked baggage screened Explosive Detection Systems manner, positive bag match, manual search, canine explosive detection, approved means. In January 2002, Company implemented bag screening program utilizing approved methods. The TSA increased security flight decks aircraft requires federal air marshals present flights. Effective February 1, 2002, ATSA imposed $2.50 enplanement security service fee ($5 one-way maximum fee) collected air carriers submitted government pay enhanced security measures. Additionally, extent TSA determines fee insufficient pay cost providing security measures mentioned previous paragraph, years 2002, 2003 2004, air carriers required submit government amount equal amount air carriers paid screening passengers property 2000. After that, fee assessed based air carrier's market share. Currently, unknown Company required make payments feature ATSA. In addition, ATSA requires air carriers honor tickets suspended service air carriers insolvent declared bankruptcy 18 months passage ATSA. To eligible, passenger make arrangements air carrier 60 days date passenger's air transportation suspended. In provision ATSA recently enacted, Company history determine impact. If major U.S. air carrier declare bankruptcy cease operations, feature ATSA significant impact Company. To extent Company reimbursed honoring tickets, impact adverse. In April 1998, issued proposed pricing capacity rules severely limit major air carriers' ability compete entrant carriers. In January 2001, multi-year investigation public docket competition major air carriers entrant carriers, restated concerns competitive practices industry, declined issue specific competitive guidelines. In statement findings conclusions, reiterated view authority obligation prevent considers unfair competitive practices industry, intent pursue enforcement actions case-by-case basis. To extent future enforcement actions directly indirectly impose restrictions Company's ability respond competitors, Company's business adversely impacted. As Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, Antitrust Division DOJ purported classes private parties pursuing litigation alleging American American Eagle violated federal antitrust laws competing air carriers. In April 2001, U.S. District Court District Kansas granted American's motion summary judgment dismissed government's case. The DOJ appealed, private lawsuits stayed pending outcome DOJ's appeal. Adverse court decisions impose restrictions Company's ability respond competitors, result awards substantial money damages private parties, case Company's business adversely impacted. AIRLINE FARES Airlines permitted establish domestic fares governmental regulation, industry characterized substantial price competition. The maintains authority international fares, rates charges. International fares rates subject jurisdiction governments foreign countries Company serves. While air carriers required file adhere international fare rate tariffs, substantial commissions, overrides discounts travel agents, brokers wholesalers characterize international markets. 5 <PAGE> Legislation (sometimes referred "Passengers' Bill Rights") discussed legislatures (including Congress). This legislation could, enacted: (i) place limitations airline fares and/or (ii) affect operating practices baggage handling overbooking. Effective December 15, 1999, Company, domestic airlines, implemented Customer Service Plan address number service goals, including, limited goals relating to: (i) lowest fare availability, (ii) delays, cancellations diversion events, (iii) baggage delivery liability, (iv) guaranteed fares, (v) ticket refunds, (vi) accommodation customers special needs, (vii) essential customer extraordinary delays, (viii) flight oversales, (ix) Frequent Flyer Program - AAdvantage, (x) travel policies, (xi) service domestic code share partners, (xii) handling customer issues. In February 2001, Inspector General issued report air carriers' performance Customer Service Plans. The report included number recommendations limit Company's flexibility respect operational practices. In February 2001, bill proposing "Airline Customer Service Improvement Act" introduced U.S. Senate. In addition, items legislation introduced limit hub concentration, reallocate slots airports impose higher landing fees hours. To extent legislation enacted inhibit Company's flexibility respect fares, revenue management system, operations aspects customer service operations, Company's financial results adversely affected. Fare discounting competitors historically negative effect Company's financial results Company generally required match competitors' fares maintain passenger traffic. During recent years, number low-cost airlines entered domestic market major airlines, including Company, implemented efforts lower cost structures. Further fare reductions, domestic international, occur future. If fare reductions offset increases passenger traffic, cost reductions mix traffic improves yields, Company's operating results negatively impacted. AIRPORT ACCESS In 1968, FAA issued rule designating New York John F. Kennedy, New York LaGuardia, Washington National (now Washington Reagan), Chicago O'Hare Newark airports high-density traffic airports. Newark subsequently removed high-density airport classification. The high-density rule limits number Instrument Flight Rule operations - take-offs landings - permitted hour requires slot support operation. In April 2000, Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment Reform Act 21st Century (Air 21 Act) enacted which: (i) eliminates slot restrictions New York's John F. Kennedy LaGuardia airports 2007, (ii) shrank Chicago O'Hare's slot day 0645 - 2114 hours 1445 - 2014 hours starting July 2001, (iii) eliminates Chicago O'Hare slots July 2002. The Company expect elimination slot restrictions material adverse impact Company's operations financial condition, results operations cash flows. In aftermath September 11, 2001, Washington Reagan reopen October 4, 2001, limited basis. The Company operations Washington Reagan allowed return pre-September 11 levels. However, late February 2002, reported U.S. Transportation Secretary propose March 2002 Washington Reagan allowed return pre-September 11 number commercial flights. Under Air 21 Act, slot restrictions lifted service to/from LaGuardia cities classified small non-hub airports (new service cities). As consequence, Company air carriers increased service LaGuardia service cities. In December 2000, held lottery LaGuardia slots service service cities order ease congestion airport. The congestion direct result growth Air 21 Act slot operations. While Company scaled back service service cities to/from LaGuardia, anticipated reduction material impact Company's operations financial condition, results operations cash flows. Currently, FAA permits purchasing, selling, leasing transferring slots slots designated international, essential air service Air 21 Act. Trading slot permitted subject parameters. Most foreign airports, including London Heathrow, major European destination American, slot allocations. Most foreign authorities permit purchasing, selling leasing slots. Although Company constrained slots, sufficient slot authorizations operate existing flights generally obtain slots expand operations change schedules. However, assurance Company obtain slots purposes future because, factors, domestic slot allocations subject government policies. 6 <PAGE> ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company subject laws government regulations environmental matters employee safety health U.S. countries. U.S. federal laws impact Company include Airport Noise Capacity Act 1990 (ANCA), Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation Recovery Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act (CERCLA Superfund Act). The Company subject oversight Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) employee safety health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, federal agencies authorized promulgate regulations impact Company's operations. In addition federal activities, states delegated authorities aforementioned federal statutes. Many state local governments adopted environmental employee safety health laws regulations, similar federal requirements. As part continuing safety, health environmental program, Company anticipates comply requirements material adverse effect business. The ANCA recognizes rights airport operators noise problems implement local noise abatement programs long interfere unreasonably interstate foreign commerce national air transportation system. Authorities cities promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including imposition nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval local noise restrictions aircraft. While Company sufficient scheduling flexibility accommodate local noise restrictions imposed date, Company's operations adversely affected locally-imposed regulations restrictive widespread. American identified EPA potentially responsible party (PRP) Operating Industries, Inc. Superfund Site California. American signed partial consent decree respect site PRPs named. American identified PRP Beede Waste Oil Superfund Site New Hampshire. American responded 104(e) Request Information interaction companies related site. At Operating Industries, Inc. Beede Waste Oil sites, American's alleged waste disposal volumes minor compared PRPs sites. In 1998, EPA named American de minimis PRP Casmalia Waste Disposal Site California. American, tenants San Francisco International Airport (SFIA), ordered California Regional Water Quality Control Board engage studies potential environmental contamination airport undertake remedial measures, necessary. SFIA seeking recover past costs related contamination tenants. Miami-Dade County investigating remediating environmental conditions Miami International Airport (MIA) funding remediation costs landing fees cost recovery methods. American AMR Eagle named PRPs contamination MIA. During quarter 2001, County filed lawsuit 17 defendants, including American, attempt recover past future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., al. Florida Circuit Court). In addition 17 defendants named lawsuit, 243 agencies companies named PRPs contributors contamination. American's AMR Eagle's portion cleanup costs estimated due factors, including unknown extent remedial actions required, proportion cost ultimately recovered responsible parties, uncertainties environmental agencies ultimately supervise remedial activities nature supervision. In 1999, American ordered New York State Department Environmental Conservation conduct remediation environmental contamination located Terminals 8 9 New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. American seeking recover portion related costs previous users premises. 7 <PAGE> Also 1999, Company entered plea agreement U.S. Government respect count indictment relating storage hazardous materials. As part plea agreement, Company probation years adopted comprehensive compliance program. To extent Company fails abide terms probation compliance program, Company's operations adversely impacted. American Executive, tenants Luis Munoz Marin International Airport San Juan, Puerto Rico, named PRPs environmental claims airport. American Eagle Airlines, Inc. notified potential liability New York law inactive hazardous waste site Poughkeepsie, New York. The Company expect matters, individually collectively, material impact financial condition, results operations cash flows. LABOR The airline business labor intensive. Wages, salaries benefits represented approximately 37 percent AMR's consolidated operating expenses year ended December 31, 2001. The majority Company's employees represented labor unions covered collective bargaining agreements. The Company's relations labor organizations governed Railway Labor Act. Under act, collective bargaining agreements Company organizations expire amendable stated date. If party wishes modify terms agreement, notify party manner agreement. After receipt notice, parties meet direct negotiations, agreement reached, party request NMB appoint federal mediator. If agreement reached mediation, NMB declare time impasse exists, impasse declared, NMB proffers binding arbitration parties. Either party decline submit arbitration. If arbitration rejected party, 30-day "cooling off" period commences. During period, Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) established, examines parties' positions recommends solution. The PEB process lasts 30 days "cooling off" period 30 days. At end "cooling off" period, agreement reached action Congress, labor organization strike airline resort "self-help", including imposition proposed amendments hiring workers replace strikers. American reached contract Association Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) 2001. The contract amendable November 30, 2004. American reached agreements Transport Workers Union (TWU) 2001 employee groups represented TWU. The agreements amendable March 1, 2004. In 2001, American commenced negotiations Allied Pilots Association (APA). The APA agreement amendable August 31, 2001. In addition, provision current APA contract limits number seat miles (ASMs) block hours flown American's regional carriers pilots American furlough. American Eagle continues accept previously ordered regional jets. This ASM cap reached half 2002, necessitating actions comply cap. American working regional partners ensure compliance provision. Towards end, American Eagle reducing number ASMs flown carriers, including, limited to: (i) removal seats Saab ATR aircraft, (ii) reduction number turboprop aircraft, (iii) reducing frequency and/or withdrawing routes network. American Eagle continue evaluate number potential alternatives involving carrier's Miami operations Executive, range changing codeshare agreement American potential sale assets. 8 <PAGE> The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), represents American Eagle pilots, reached agreement American Eagle effective September 1, 1997, pilots Eagle carriers covered single collective bargaining agreement. This agreement lasts October 31, 2013. The agreement parties seek limited 2000, 2004, 2008 2012. If parties unable agree limited changes, agreed issues resolved interest arbitration, exercise self-help (such strike). ALPA American Eagle negotiated tentative agreement 2000, agreement failed ratification. Thereafter, parties participated interest arbitration. The interest arbitration panel determined limited made appropriately effected. The Association Flight Attendants (AFA), represents flight attendants Eagle carriers, reached agreement American Eagle effective March 2, 1998, flight attendants American Eagle carriers covered single contract. The agreement amendable September 2, 2001. However, parties agreed commence negotiations amendments agreement March 2001. The parties engaged direct negotiations. The union employees American Eagle carriers covered separate agreements TWU effective April 28, 1998, amendable April 28, 2003. The portions Company's work force non-union largely incorporated counterparts TWA. With respect integration unionized portions work forces American TWA, Company engaged facilitators work American's TWA's unions attempting achieve integration agreements acceptable unions. Unfortunately, discussions unable produce agreements acceptable unions class craft. American reached integration agreements APA (with respect pilot integration issues) APFA (with respect flight attendant integration issues). Discussions TWU result agreement integration work groups represented American TWU. However, American TWU participating arbitration respect integration issues late February early March 2002. The International Association Machinists, represents work groups TWA, participating well. The details arbitration agreement worked out. Currently, NMB petition declare American TWA single carrier labor relations purposes representation effects ruling (a single carrier ruling believed occur). It expected NMB designate American's incumbent unions collective bargaining representatives combined work groups single carrier found exist. The integration unionized work groups follow schedule worked American relevant unions. FUEL The Company's operations significantly affected availability price jet fuel. The Company's fuel costs consumption years 1999 2001 were: <Table> <Caption> Average Cost Per Average Gallon, Percent Gallons Cost Per Excluding AMR's Consumed Total Cost Gallon Fuel Taxes Operating Year (in millions) (in millions) (in cents) (in cents) Expenses ---- ------------- ------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> 1999 3,084 $1,696 55.0 50.4 10.2 2000 3,197 2,495 78.1 72.8 13.6 2001 3,461 2,888* 81.4* 76.4* 13.5 </Table> * The amounts 2001 reflect January 1, 2001 adoption Statement Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting Derivative Instruments Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133); 2000 1999 amounts not. See discussion impact SFAS 133 Company Note 8 consolidated financial statements. 9 <PAGE> The impact fuel price Company competitors dependent factors, including hedging strategies. The Company fuel hedging program enters jet fuel, heating oil crude swap option contracts protect increases jet fuel prices, effect reducing Company's average cost gallon. During 2001 2000, Company's fuel hedging program reduced Company's fuel expense approximately $29 million $545 million, respectively. To reduce impact potential fuel price increases 2002, December 31, 2001, Company hedged approximately 40 percent estimated 2002 fuel requirements. Based projected fuel usage, Company estimates 10 percent increase price gallon fuel result increase aircraft fuel expense approximately $169 million 2002, net fuel hedge instruments outstanding December 31, 2001. Due competitive nature airline industry, event continuing increases price jet fuel, assurance Company pass increased fuel prices customers increasing fares. Likewise, potential benefit lower fuel prices offset increased fare competition lower revenues air carriers. While Company anticipate significant reduction fuel availability, dependency foreign imports crude oil possibility government policy jet fuel production, transportation marketing make impossible predict future availability jet fuel. In event outbreak hostilities conflicts oil producing areas, reductions production and/or importation crude oil. If major reductions availability jet fuel, Company's business adversely affected. Additional information Company's fuel program included Item 7(A) - Quantitative Qualitative Disclosures Market Risk Note 8 consolidated financial statements. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM American established AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) develop passenger loyalty offering awards travelers continued patronage. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits flights American, American Eagle participating airlines, utilizing services program participants, including hotels, car rental companies bank credit card issuers. American sells mileage credits related services companies participating program. American reserves change AAdvantage program rules, regulations, travel awards special offers time notice. American initiate impacting, example, participant affiliations, rules earning mileage credit, mileage levels awards, limited seating travel awards, features special offers. American reserves end AAdvantage program months' notice. Mileage credits redeemed free, discounted upgraded travel American, American Eagle participating airlines, travel industry awards. Once member accrues sufficient mileage award, member request award certificate American. Award certificates redeemed year issuance. Most travel awards subject capacity controlled seating. In 1999, made AAdvantage program miles expire, provided customer type qualifying activity 36 months. American utilizes incremental cost method account portion frequent flyer liability incurred AAdvantage members earn mileage credits flying American American Eagle. American's frequent flyer liability accrued time member accumulates sufficient mileage account claim lowest level free travel award (25,000 miles) award expected free travel. American includes fuel, food, reservations/ticketing costs, contribution overhead profit, calculation incremental cost. These estimates based Company's 12-month historical average costs. The cost fuel estimated based total fuel consumption tracked categories markets, amount allocated passenger. Food costs tracked market category, amount allocated passenger. Reservation/ticketing costs based total number passengers, including traveling free awards, divided American's total expense costs. 10 <PAGE> Revenue earned selling AAdvantage miles companies participating American's frequent flyer program recognized components.
