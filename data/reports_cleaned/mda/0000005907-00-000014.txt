INTRODUCTION In 1999, made significant strides transform AT&T deliver growth. We finalized strategic acquisitions announced 1998 made additional investments support facilities-based growth strategy. We continued maintain execution-focused culture AT&T. One dynamic areas 1999 wireless business. Increasing demand wireless services continued appeal Digital One Rate (sm) plans drove Wireless Services revenue grow approximately 40% year. Throughout 1999 continued expand national footprint. In quarter, completed acquisition Vanguard Cellular Systems, announced 1998; August closed acquisition Honolulu Cellular; October announced acquisition American Cellular Corp. newly created joint venture AT&T Dobson Communications. We capped year proposing creation class tracking stock reflect economic performance AT&T Wireless Group. While Wireless Group remain part AT&T, separate tracking stock provide current shareowners future investors security tied directly performance business. As worked grow wireless businesses 1999, started putting bricks mortar broadband plans - key component growth strategy. We completed $52 billion merger Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) March, quickly accelerated upgrade TCI cable plant, enable develop additional revenue streams any-distance cable telephony, high-speed data, digital video. By end 1999, TCI, renamed AT&T Broadband, offering cable telephony 16 cities pilot markets, digital-video subscribers totaled approximately 1.8 million, 200,000 customers signed high-speed data service. To expand national cable network AT&T Broadband's systems, announced May $57 billion merger MediaOne. When merger completed 2000, significantly increase presence major metropolitan markets country owned operated cable systems passing 26 million homes. In addition accomplishments domestic growth initiatives, made significant progress global strategy. Most notably, launched Concert - leading global telecommunications company created AT&T's joint venture British Telecommunications plc (BT). Concert represents core global strategy began serving multinational business customers, international carriers Internet service providers January 2000. As part relationship Concert BT, made in-country facility-based investments 1999, including AT&T Canada Corp., Rogers Cantel Canada, Telecom. We completed purchase IBM Global Network Services provide data networking services businesses world AT&T Global Network Services (AGNS). [Included 1999 Annual Report pie charts entitled "Revenue Diversification Product."

We <PAGE> delivered revenue growth 6.2% pro forma basis acquisitions AT&T Broadband AGNS, hitting targeted range 5% 7%. The majority increase growth businesses, showing success investment strategy begins shift revenue base long distance voice revenue. Just year ago, long distance voice revenue 75% total revenue; 1999 dropped 62%. While long distance increasingly commodity, evidenced continued pricing pressures industry, current profitability supports investments growth businesses. These growth businesses turn support long distance business include long distance component bundle competitively priced services. In order competitive, low-cost provider industry, therefore, continuing efforts reduce cost structure. A year ago, committed reducing 1999 selling, general administrative (SG&A) expenses 23% revenue. We beat target, delivering SG&A expense-to-revenue ratio 21.7% year, translates approximately $830 million SG&A expense savings compared targets. The fourth quarter 21.2%. That's dramatic improvement 1997, SG&A expense-to-revenue ratio year 27.9%. While successful driving costs business, do. We continue attack costs committed cutting $2 billion costs end 2000 continuing streamline SG&A expenses lowering network costs moving data, voice wireless traffic expanding network global facilities. Not surprisingly, success growing revenue shrinking costs allowed deliver strong cash flow results 1999, cash operations growing $11.6 billion - 13.9% 1998. In 1999, generated $18.3 billion reported EBITDA [earnings, including income (expense), interest, taxes, depreciation amortization]. As anticipated, positive impact revenue growth cost controls earnings share offset impact shares issued franchise, goodwill purchased intangibles amortization investments acquisitions. As result, earnings diluted share 10.3% 1998. We undertook aggressive stock buyback program offset dilutive impacts acquisitions, half 1998 repurchased 220 million shares, cost approximately $10 billion. In 2000, plan repurchase 50 million shares Cox Communications, Inc., exchange cable properties cash. We've long 1999. As pages present detail, made solid progress strategy transform AT&T, delivered commitments growth expense control. There done, finished 1999 pride accomplishments confidence ability sustain momentum accelerate growth 2000.

Franchise costs represent attributable agreement local authorities access homes Broadband's service areas. Other purchased intangibles arising business combinations primarily included customer lists licenses. In addition amortization goodwill reflected here, amortization goodwill nonconsolidated investments recorded component income (expense). This amortization totaled $495 million, $52 million $66 million 1999, 1998 1997, respectively. Net Restructuring Other Charges During 1999, recorded $1,506 million net restructuring charges, approximate $0.37 impact earnings diluted share. A $594 million in-process research development charge recorded reflecting estimated fair research development projects Broadband, date acquisition, reached technological feasibility alternative future use. The projects identified related Broadband's efforts offer voice IP, product-integration efforts advanced set-top devices, cost-savings efforts cable telephony implementation in-process research development related Excite@Home. We estimated fair in-process research development project income approach, adjusted allocate fair based project's percentage completion. Under approach, present anticipated future benefits projects determined discount rate 17%. For project, resulting net present multiplied percentage completion based effort expended date versus projected costs complete. The charge voice IP technology, voice telephony traffic digitized transmitted IP data packets, $225 million date acquisition. Current voice IP equipment support features required connect customer premises equipment traditional phone networks. Further technical development needed ensure voice quality comparable conventional circuit-switched telephony reduce power consumption IP telephony equipment. We anticipate test IP telephony equipment field deployment late 2000. The charge Broadband's product-integration efforts advanced set-top devices, enable offer next-generation digital services, $114 million date acquisition. The technology consists development integration work needed provide suite software tools run digital set-top box hardware platform. It anticipated field trials begin mid 2000 next-generation digital services. The charge Broadband's cost-savings efforts cable telephony implementation $101 million date acquisition. Telephony cost reductions primarily consist cost savings development "line power switch," Broadband cost effectively provide power customer telephony equipment cable plant. This device provide line-powered telephony burying cable line house. The device requires development order reach acceptable level reliability. We expect test deploy devices end 2000. <PAGE> Additionally, in-process research development charge related Excite@Home valued $154 million. During quarter 1999, ceased consolidate Excite@Home began account investment equity method accounting due corporate governance changes, resulted AT&T longer holding controlling financial interest. Accordingly, longer report in-process research development projects Excite@Home. Although significant technological issues overcome order successfully complete acquired in-process research development, expect successful completion. We estimate costs complete identified projects material impact results operations. If, however, unable establish technological feasibility produce commercially viable products/services, anticipated incremental future cash flows attributable expected profits products/services realized. A $531 million asset impairment charge primarily recorded association planned disposal wireless network equipment resulting program increase capacity operating efficiency wireless network. As part multivendor program, contracts executed vendors replace significant portions wireless infrastructure equipment western United States metropolitan New York markets. The program provide Wireless Services newest technology evolve new, third-generation digital technology, high-speed data capabilities. The planned disposal existing wireless infrastructure equipment required evaluation asset impairment accordance Statement Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121 "Accounting Impairment Long-Lived Assets Long-Lived Assets Be Disposed Of" write-down assets fair value, estimated discounting expected future cash flows assets date disposal. Since assets remain service date decision dispose assets disposal date, remaining net book assets depreciated period. A $145 million charge restructuring exit costs recorded part AT&T's initiative reduce costs $2 billion end 2000. The restructuring exit plans primarily focus maximization synergies headcount reductions Business Services network operations, including consolidation customer-care call centers. Included exit costs $142 million cash termination benefits separation approximately 2,800 employees part voluntary involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half separations management employees one-half nonmanagement employees. Approximately 1,700 employee separations related involuntary terminations approximately 1,100 related voluntary terminations. Nearly 80% affected employees left positions December 31, 1999, remaining employees leave company early 2000. Termination benefits $40 million paid fourth quarter 1999. This cash outlay primarily funded cash operations. The balance cash termination payments expected paid quarter 2000. The restructuring initiative projected yield cash savings approximately $250 million year, EBIT [earnings, including <PAGE> income (expense), interest taxes] savings approximately $200 million 2000 $400 million year thereafter. We expect increased spending growth businesses largely offset cash EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable reduced personnel-related expenses, realized SG&A expenses network costs services. EBIT savings 2000 expected partially offset accelerated depreciation expense. However, depreciation expense subsequent years lower related 1999 write-off Wireless Services' assets. In addition, continuing efforts reduce costs $2 billion end 2000 planned merger MediaOne require charges exit separation plans, expect finalized half 2000. We recorded net losses $307 million related government-mandated disposition international businesses competed directly Concert, $50 million related contribution agreement Broadband entered Phoenixstar, Inc., requires Broadband satisfy liabilities owed Phoenixstar subsidiaries.

A restructuring charge $2,724 million composed $2,254 million $169 million pension postretirement special-termination benefits, respectively, $263 million curtailment losses $38 million administrative costs. We recorded charges $125 million related facility costs $150 million executive-separation costs. These charges partially offset benefits $940 million settled pension benefit obligations 13,700 total VRIP employees. In addition, VRIP charges partially offset reversal $256 million 1995 business restructuring reserves primarily resulting overlap VRIP 1995 projects. Also included 1998 net restructuring charges asset impairment charges totaling $718 million, $633 million related decision pursue Total Service Resale (TSR) local service strategy. We recorded $85 million asset impairment charge related write-down unrecoverable assets international operations carrying longer supported future cash flows. This charge made connection review operations competed directly Concert. Additionally, $85 million merger-related expenses recorded 1998 connection Teleport Communications Group Inc.
