Accordingly, charge $29.6 million recorded Cost Goods Sold write assets estimated fair market value. Approximately 80% charge related machinery, equipment tooling Company's City Hattiesburg, Mississippi manufacturing plants, estimated fair derived auction process. The remainder charge related tooling equipment facilities, nominal fair market derived auction process. These assets service time write-down depreciated write-down. The net carrying assets write-down approximated $2.2 million assets expected disposed September 30, 1999. Depreciation expense assets approximated $2.6 million 1998, $4.2 million 1997 $3.5 million 1996.

Higher inventory levels 1998 costs outsourcing small parts fulfillment led higher distribution warehousing costs approximately $12 million. Increased environmental reserves divested closed facilities added approximately $5 million. Approximately half environmental reserve increase reflected revisions estimates costs remediate existing sites. These revisions based obtaining additional information fourth quarter 1998 costs planned remediation actions costs additional remediation actions. The remaining amount provide revisions reserves estimated losses damages related environmental sites. These revisions based obtaining additional information fourth quarter 1998 level damages sought costs probability defending Company's position actions. Settlement patent infringement action resulted additional expense approximately $4 million. Remaining legal expenses recorded year approximately $1 million investigation, defense settlement previously existing issues equal amounts incurred similar items 1997. Additionally, above, SG&A includes $14.1 million legal costs recorded 1998 restatement efforts. Amounts accrued litigation matters represent anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement amounts) connection pending litigation claims related anticipated legal fees. The costs accrued probable asset impaired liability incurred amount 31 <PAGE> estimated. The accruals based Company's assessment, consultation counsel, probable loss based facts circumstances case, legal issues involved, nature claim made, nature damages sought relevant information plaintiff, significant factors vary case. When estimate specific expected amount loss incurred, Company evaluates range losses records minimum end range. As December 31, 1998 December 28, 1997, Company established accruals litigation matters $31.2 million (representing $17.5 million $13.7 million estimated damages settlement amounts legal fees, respectively) $9.9 million (representing $3.0 million $6.9 million estimated damages settlement amounts legal fees, respectively), respectively.

The Company believes, based information December 31, 1998, anticipated probable costs litigation matters existing December 31, 1998 adequately reserved extent determinable. During 1997, Company determined amounts accrued December 29, 1996 Restructuring Asset Impairment Charges recorded fiscal 1996 exceeded amounts ultimately required. Accordingly, 1997 Consolidated Statement Operations reflects reversal accruals longer required, resulting Restructuring Asset Impairment Benefit $14.6 million.

These benefits realized deferred tax credits established connection acquisitions extent credits expected realized loss carryforward period. Throughout 1998, Company increased income tax valuation allowance deferred tax assets $290.5 million. This increase reflects management's assessment deferred tax assets realized future taxable income.
