OUTLOOK Due part lack predictability future traffic, business mix yields, Company continues difficulty estimating impact events September 11, 2001. However, magnitude unprecedented events, Company expects adverse impact Company - - airline industry - continue significant 2002. Because high degree uncertainty, Company provide estimate full year 2002. However, Company expect incur sizable loss quarter, incur loss 2002. Capacity American - reflects TWA quarter 2002 quarter 2001 - expected increase percent quarter 2002 compared year's quarter levels. American Eagle's capacity slightly (see page 8 additional information American Eagle's capacity). Capacity remainder 2002 clear depends number factors, including, limited to, quickly demand returns levels capacity Company's competitors deploy. Traffic continues remain challenging predict. However, quarter 2002, Company expects traffic percent year's quarter levels. In response September 11 terrorist attacks, Company put place numerous cost reduction initiatives, including, limited to: cutting capacity, grounding aircraft deferring aircraft deliveries future years, sharply reducing capital spending, closing facilities, trimming food service reducing workforce. In addition, Company expects lower fuel prices quarter 2002 compared 2001.
