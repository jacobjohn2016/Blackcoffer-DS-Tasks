Approximately $2.1 billion increase due impact acquisitions consolidation Excite@Home, offset impact Concert, dispositions elimination PICC. The remaining $1.3 billion increase primarily driven growing demand wireless data Internet protocol (IP) products, outsourcing services, partially offset continued accelerating declines long distance voice revenue. We expect long distance revenue continue negatively impacted ongoing competition product substitution. Total revenue 1999 increased $9.4 billion, 17.6%, compared 1998. Nearly three-quarters increase due acquisitions, net dispositions. The remaining increase fueled growth wireless, business data, business long distance voice outsourcing revenue, partially offset continued decline consumer long distance voice revenue. Revenue segment discussed greater detail segment results section. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Costs services products........................................ $17,587 $14,594 $10,495 </TABLE> Costs services products include costs operating maintaining networks, costs support outsourcing contracts, fees paid wireless carriers networks (off-network roaming), programming licensing costs cable services, costs wireless handsets sold, provision uncollectible receivables service-related costs. These costs increased $3.0 billion, 20.5%, 2000 compared 1999. Nearly $2.1 billion increase due acquisitions impact consolidating Excite@Home, net impact Concert divestments international businesses. The higher costs growing wireless subscriber base wireless network outsourcing contracts increased expenses approximately $1.5 billion. The higher wireless expenses primarily related higher costs handsets sold, due 53.5% increase gross subscriber additions 2000 compared 1999. Expenses increased due higher video-programming costs principally due rate increases, higher costs broadband services approximately $0.3 billion. These increases partially offset approximately $0.9 billion costs savings continued cost control initiatives higher pension credit 2000, primarily driven higher pension trust asset base, resulting increased investment returns. Costs services products rose $4.1 billion, 39.1%, 1999 compared 1998, primarily due acquisitions, net dispositions, accounted approximately $3.7 billion increase. The higher costs growing wireless subscriber base outsourcing contracts increased expenses approximately $1.5 billion. Partially offsetting 1999 increases network cost-control initiatives approximately $0.4 billion, approximately $0.3 billion lower expenses Business Services related per-call compensation expense, provision uncollectible receivables gross receipts property taxes. <PAGE> <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Access connection........................................... $13,518 $14,686 $15,328 </TABLE> Access connection expenses decreased 8.0%, $13.5 billion 2000, compared $14.7 billion 1999. Included access connection expenses costs pay connect domestic calls facilities service providers. Mandated reductions per-minute access costs decreased per-line charges resulted lower costs approximately $1.5 billion. Also contributing decrease efficient network usage. These decreases partially offset approximately $0.7 billion higher costs due volume increases, $0.5 billion result higher Universal Service Fund contributions. Since charges passed customer, per-minute access-rate per-line charge reductions increased Universal Service Fund contributions generally resulted impact revenue. Costs paid telephone companies United States connect calls made countries United States (international settlements) included access connection expenses. These costs decreased approximately $0.5 billion 2000, result commencement operations Concert. Concert incurs international settlements earns foreign-billed revenue, previously incurred earned directly AT&T. In 2000, Concert billed net expense composed international settlement (interconnection) expense foreign-billed revenue. The amount charged Concert 2000 lower interconnection expense incurred 1999, AT&T recorded transactions revenue expense, applicable. Partially offsetting decline costs incurred related Concert products AT&T sells customers. Access connection expenses declined $0.6 billion, 4.2%, 1999 compared prior year. This decline resulted $0.9 billion mandated reductions per-minute access rates 1999 1998, $0.6 billion lower international settlement rates resulting negotiations international carriers. Additionally, continue manage costs efficient network usage. These reductions partially offset $0.8 billion higher costs due volume growth, $0.3 billion result increased per-line charges Universal Service Fund contributions. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Selling, general administrative................................... $13,303 $13,516 $12,770 </TABLE> Selling, general administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $0.2 billion, 1.6%, 2000 compared 1999. Approximately $2.0 billion decrease due savings continued cost-control initiatives higher pension credit 2000, primarily driven higher pension trust asset base, resulting increased investment returns. Largely offsetting decrease $1.4 billion higher expenses growing wireless broadband businesses, $0.7 billion expenses acquisitions consolidation Excite@Home, net impact Concert dispositions. <PAGE> SG&A expenses increased $0.7 billion, 5.8%, 1999 compared 1998. This increase primarily due acquisitions, net dispositions, resulted increase SG&A expenses approximately $1.4 billion. Also contributing increase approximately $0.4 billion higher costs support growing wireless subscriber base. Partially offsetting increases continued efforts control costs companywide basis, resulted lower SG&A expenses approximately $0.9 billion, including lower spending consumer long distance acquisition-programs. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Depreciation amortization....................................... $7,274 $6,138 $4,378 </TABLE> Depreciation amortization expenses rose $1.1 billion, 18.5%, 2000 compared 1999 increased $1.8 billion, 40.2%, 1999 compared 1998. Approximately one-half increase years due acquisitions consolidation Excite@Home, net dispositions impact Concert, applicable. The remaining increase primarily due higher asset base resulting continued infrastructure investment. Total capital expenditures 2000, 1999 1998 $14.6 billion, $13.5 billion $8.0 billion, respectively. We continue focus vast majority capital spending growth businesses broadband, wireless, data IP local. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Amortization goodwill, franchise costs purchased intangibles.... $2,993 $1,301 $251 </TABLE> Amortization goodwill, franchise costs purchased intangibles increased $1.7 billion, 130.1%, 2000 compared prior year. This increase largely attributable consolidation Excite@Home, acquisitions, primarily MediaOne TCI. Franchise costs represent attributable agreements local authorities access homes Broadband's service areas. Other purchased intangibles arising business combinations primarily included customer relationships licenses. Amortization goodwill, franchise costs purchased intangibles increased $1.1 billion 1999 compared 1998 due primarily acquisition TCI and, lesser extent, AGNS. As result evaluation recent industry views regulatory authorities, AT&T expects amortization period licensing costs, franchise costs, goodwill newly acquired wireless, telecommunications, cable operations exceed 25 years. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Net restructuring charges....................................... $7,029 $1,506 $2,514 </TABLE> <PAGE> During 2000, recorded $7.0 billion net restructuring charges, approximate $0.90 earnings diluted share impact AT&T Common Stock Group. The 2000 charge included $6.2 billion asset impairment charges related Excite@Home, $759 million restructuring exit costs AT&T's initiative reduce costs, $91 million related government-mandated disposition AT&T Communications (U.K.) Ltd., competed directly Concert. The asset impairment charges related Excite@Home resulted deterioration market conditions market valuations Internet-related companies fourth quarter 2000, caused Excite@Home conclude intangible assets related acquisitions Internet-related companies recoverable. Accordingly, Excite@Home conducted detailed assessment recoverability carrying amounts acquired intangible assets. This assessment resulted determination acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, related acquisitions, including Excite, impaired December 31, 2000. As result, Excite@Home recorded impairment charges $4.6 billion December 2000, representing excess carrying amount impaired assets fair value. The impairment allocated asset group based comparison carrying values fair values. The impairment write-down asset group allocated goodwill, goodwill reduced zero, identifiable intangible assets proportion carrying values. Since approximately 23% Excite@Home, 77% charge recorded Excite@Home included reduction AT&T's net income, eliminated 2000 Consolidated Statement Income "Minority interest income (expense)." Also result foregoing, AT&T recorded goodwill acquisition-related impairment charge $1.6 billion acquisition investment Excite@Home. The write-down investment fair determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows. The $759 million charge restructuring exit plans primarily due headcount reductions, network operations Business Services, including consolidation customer-care call centers, synergies created MediaOne merger. Included exit costs $503 million cash termination benefits separation approximately 7,300 employees part voluntary involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half separations management employees one-half nonmanagement employees. Approximately 6,700 employee separations related involuntary terminations approximately 600 voluntary terminations. We recorded $62 million network lease contract termination costs penalties incurred part notifying vendors termination contracts year, net losses $32 million related disposition facilities primarily due synergies created MediaOne merger. Also included restructuring exit costs 2000 $144 million benefit plan curtailment costs employee separations part exit plans. Further, recorded asset impairment charge $18 million related write-down unrecoverable assets businesses carrying longer supported estimated future cash flows. <PAGE> The 2000 restructuring initiatives projected yield cash savings approximately $690 million year, EBIT (earnings interest taxes, including pretax minority interest net pretax losses equity investments) savings approximately $700 million year. We expect increased spending growth businesses largely offset cash EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable reduced personnel-related expenses, realized SG&A expenses costs services products. During 1999, recorded $1.5 billion net restructuring charges, approximate $0.37 earnings diluted share impact AT&T Common Stock Group. A $594 million in-process research development charge recorded reflecting estimated fair research development projects TCI, date acquisition, reached technological feasibility alternative future use. The projects identified related efforts offer voice IP, product-integration efforts advanced set-top devices, cost-savings efforts broadband-telephony implementation, in-process research development related Excite@Home. We estimated fair in-process research development project income approach, adjusted allocate fair based project's percentage completion. Under approach, present anticipated future benefits projects determined discount rate 17%. For project, resulting net present multiplied percentage completion based effort expended date versus projected costs complete. The charge voice-over-IP technology, voice telephony traffic digitized transmitted IP data packets, $225 million date acquisition. Current voice-over-IP equipment support features required connect customer premises equipment traditional phone networks. Further technical development needed ensure voice quality comparable conventional circuit-switched telephony reduce power consumption IP-telephony equipment. We started testing IP-telephony equipment field late-2000 continue tests 2001. The charge product-integration efforts advanced set-top devices, enable offer next-generation digital services, $114 million acquisition date. The technology consists development integration work needed provide suite software tools run digital set-top box hardware platform. It anticipated field trials begin late-2001 next-generation digital services. The charge cost-savings efforts broadband-telephony implementation $101 million date acquisition. Telephony cost reductions primarily consist cost savings development "line power switch," cost effectively provide power customer telephony equipment cable plant. This device provide line-powered telephony burying cable line house. Trials related telephony cost reductions complete, implementation begun markets. Additionally, in-process research development charge related Excite@Home valued $154 million. This charge related projects self-provisioning devices development next-generation client software, network back-office infrastructure enable variety network devices personal computers improved design regional data centers' infrastructure. <PAGE> Although technological issues overcome successfully complete acquired in-process research development, expect successful completion. We estimate costs complete identified projects material impact results operations. If, however, unable establish technological feasibility produce commercially viable products/services, anticipated incremental future cash flows attributable expected profits products/services realized. A $531 million asset impairment charge recorded 1999 planned disposal wireless communications equipment resulting program increase capacity operating efficiency wireless network. As part multivendor program, contracts executed select vendors replace significant portions wireless infrastructure equipment western United States metropolitan New York markets. The program intended provide Wireless Services newest technology evolve new, next-generation digital technology, designed provide high-speed data capabilities. Since assets remain service date decision dispose assets disposal date, remaining net book assets depreciated period. Also 1999, $145 million charge restructuring exit costs recorded part AT&T's initiative reduce costs. The restructuring exit plans primarily focused maximization synergies headcount reductions Business Services network operations, including consolidation customer-care call centers. Included exit costs $142 million cash termination benefits separation approximately 2,800 employees part voluntary involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half separations management employees one-half nonmanagement employees. Approximately 1,700 employee separations related involuntary terminations approximately 1,100 voluntary terminations. The 1999 restructuring initiatives projected yield cash savings approximately $250 million year. This restructuring yielded EBIT savings approximately $200 million 2000, expected save $400 million year thereafter. We expect increased spending growth businesses largely offset cash EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable reduced personnel-related expenses, realized SG&A expenses costs services products. We recorded net losses $307 million related government-mandated disposition international businesses competed directly Concert, $50 million related contribution agreement Broadband entered Phoenixstar, Inc. That agreement requires Broadband satisfy liabilities owed Phoenixstar subsidiaries. The remaining obligation contribution agreement agreement MediaOne $57 million, fully accrued December 31, 2000. In addition, recorded benefits $121 million related settlement pension obligations employees accepted AT&T's 1998 voluntary retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer. During 1998, recorded $2.5 billion net restructuring charges, approximate $0.59 earnings diluted share impact AT&T Common Stock Group. The bulk charge cost-reduction program approximately 15,300 management employees accepted VRIP offer. A restructuring charge $2,724 million composed <PAGE> $2,254 million $169 million pension postretirement special-termination benefits, respectively, $263 million benefit plan curtailment losses $38 million administrative costs. We recorded charges $125 million related facility costs $150 million executive-separation costs. These charges partially offset benefits $940 million settled pension benefit obligations 13,700 total VRIP employees. In addition, VRIP charges partially offset reversal $256 million 1995 business restructuring reserves primarily resulting overlap VRIP 1995 projects. Also included 1998 net restructuring charges asset impairment charges totaling $718 million, $633 million related decision pursue Total Service Resale (TSR) local-service strategy. We recorded $85 million asset impairment charge related write-down unrecoverable assets international operations carrying longer supported future cash flows. This charge made connection review operations competed directly Concert. Additionally, $85 million merger-related expenses recorded 1998 connection Teleport Communications Group Inc. (TCG) merger, accounted pooling interests. Partially offsetting charges $92 million reversal 1995 restructuring reserve. This reversal reflected reserves longer deemed necessary. The reversal primarily included separation costs attributed projects completed cost lower originally anticipated. Consistent three-year plan, 1995 restructuring initiatives substantially completed end 1998. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Operating income......................................................... $4,277 $10,859 $7,487 </TABLE> Operating income decreased $6.6 billion, 60.6%, 2000 compared 1999.
