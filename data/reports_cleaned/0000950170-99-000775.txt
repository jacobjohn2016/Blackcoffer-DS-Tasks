This increase reflects results lower overhead spending, improved factory utilization labor cost benefits resulting Company's restructuring plan, coupled reductions materials costs. The lower overhead spending resulted reduction number facilities operated Company. With fewer facilities production purposes, capacity remaining plants fully utilized. The labor cost benefits realized principally shifting production Mexico. In addition, broad based program obtain lower costs materials contributed 1997 margin improvement.

SUNBEAM'S APPROACH 2000 ISSUES While Company's Year 2000 readiness planning underway year, quarter 1998 Company established cross-functional project team consisting senior managers, assisted external consulting firms retained provide consulting services assist Company implementing Year 2000 strategy. This team sponsored Company's Chief Financial Officer reports directly Company's Chief Executive Officer issue. The Audit Committee Board Directors advised periodically status Company's Year 2000 readiness program. 35 <PAGE> The Year 2000 project team developed phased approach identify resolve Year 2000 issues activities conducted parallel.

All information relative item tracked Company's Year 2000 database. The Company completed phase fourth quarters 1998. The Company completed review readiness embedded microprocessors products determined Company's products Year 2000 date sensitive systems. PHASE 2 - CORRECTION TESTING: The phase Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program structured replace, upgrade remediate (as necessary) items identified Phase 1 requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies functions perform tasks critical operations. Significant transactions impacted ready Year 2000 issues include, others, purchases materials, production management, order entry fulfillment, payroll processing. Systems applications identified Sunbeam date Year 2000 ready critical Sunbeam's operations include financial software systems, process order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable functions, payroll applications, critical applications Company's manufacturing distribution facilities, warehouse management applications. In 1997, Company began implementing uniform international business accounting information system improve internal reporting processes. Based representations manufacturer current version uniform information system Year 2000 ready, Company actively upgrading business sites utilize uniform system Year 2000 ready version. A small number Company business locations replacing current non-Year 2000 ready systems uniform system. The Company actively replacing and/or upgrading legacy business systems Year 2000 ready, including localized business system packages candidates replaced uniform business accounting information system. With respect Company's non-IT systems (for example, time attendance, security, in-line manufacturing hardware) Company actively analyzing items assess Year 2000 issues. To date, material issues discovered, Company continue review, test correct, necessary, items. Sunbeam plans complete corrective work respect systems quarter 1999 final testing implementation systems occurring quarters 1999. PHASE 3 - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS BUSINESS PARTNERS: The phase Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program initiated fourth quarters 1998 designed assess interact Company's customers, suppliers, business partners. As part effort, Company surveyed 1,100 vendors suppliers determined critical Company. Based survey, Company believes low medium risk Year 2000 issues approximately one-third vendors; however, small number vendors identified high risk (less 3%) two-thirds vendors respond fully survey. The Company continue vendor evaluation assessment process 1999, including direct contact high medium risk vendors vendors responded fully Company's survey. The Company independently verified responses vendors anticipate undertaking independent verification process. Beginning quarter 1999, Sunbeam contact major customers confirm preparations Year 2000 issues.

In order improve Company's 36 <PAGE> communication customers, suppliers business partners, Company set Sunbeam Year 2000 telephone number process providing Year 2000 information Company web site. PHASE 4 - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involve contingency planning unresolved Year 2000 issues, issues arising party suppliers. The Company's Year 2000 readiness program ongoing ultimate scope, consideration contingency plans, continue evaluated information available. As precautionary measure, Sunbeam plans establish contingency plan addressing effects Year 2000 operations, due Sunbeam's systems parties ready Year 2000 issues. Sunbeam expects complete contingency plan September 30, 1999; contingency plan address alternative processes, manual procedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative service providers, plans address Year 2000 readiness issues arise. RISKS SUNBEAM'S 2000 APPROACH The independent consultants assisting Company Year 2000 readiness program reviewed concurred Company's approach, assisted developing cost estimates monitored costs largest single component (upgrade installation Company's uniform system) Company's Year 2000 program. As result, Company engage independent party verify program's approach total cost, Company believes Company's exposure regard mitigated. In addition, external third-party diagnostic tools helped identify potential Year 2000 issues significant business operation, Company believes mitigated risk validating verifying key program components. Management believes that, significant systems modified replaced, Sunbeam's information systems environment made Year 2000 ready prior January 1, 2000. Sunbeam's failure timely complete corrective work material adverse impact Company. With respect customers, suppliers business partners, failure parties Year 2000 ready material adverse impact Sunbeam. For example, failure Company's principal suppliers Year 2000 ready internal systems impact Company's ability manufacture and/or ship products maintain adequate inventory levels production. At time, Company believes "worst-case" scenario relating Year 2000 involves potential disruptions areas Company's operations rely parties, suppliers, systems work properly January 1, 2000. While system failures directly indirectly affect important operations Company subsidiaries significant manner, Company present estimate likelihood potential cost failures. Subject nature goods services provided Company parties operations made ready Year 2000 issues, impact Sunbeam's operations material contingency plans developed prior January 1, 2000. The nature focus Company's efforts address Year 2000 problem revised periodically interim goals achieved issues identified. In addition, important note description Company's efforts assessments necessarily involves estimates projections respect activities required future. These estimates projections subject change work continues, substantial. COSTS ADDRESS COMPANY'S 2000 ISSUES Through December 31, 1998, Sunbeam expended approximately $19 million address Year 2000 issues approximately half recorded capital expenditures remainder SG&A expense.

The amount incurred Year 2000 issues 1999 approximately $41 million represents 50% Company's total 1999 budget information systems related support, including Year 2000 costs. A large majority costs expected incremental expenditures recur Year 2000 thereafter. Fees expenses related party consultants, involved PMO modification replacement software, represent approximately 75% total estimated cost. The balance total estimated cost relates primarily software license fees hardware, excludes costs Company employees. Sunbeam expects expenditures financed operating cash flows borrowings, applicable. A significant portion expenditures enhance Sunbeam's operating systems addition resolving Year 2000 issues. As Sunbeam completes assessment Year 2000 issues, actual expenditures incurred incurred differ materially amounts shown above. 37 <PAGE> Because Year 2000 readiness critical business, Sunbeam redeployed resources non-critical system enhancements address Year 2000 issues. In addition, due importance systems Company's business, management deferred non-critical systems enhancements possible. The Company expect redeployments deferrals material impact Company's financial condition, results operations cash flows.
