We finalized strategic acquisitions announced 1998 made additional investments support facilities-based growth strategy. We continued maintain execution-focused culture AT&T. One dynamic areas 1999 wireless business. Increasing demand wireless services continued appeal Digital One Rate (sm) plans drove Wireless Services revenue grow approximately 40% year. Throughout 1999 continued expand national footprint. In quarter, completed acquisition Vanguard Cellular Systems, announced 1998; August closed acquisition Honolulu Cellular; October announced acquisition American Cellular Corp. newly created joint venture AT&T Dobson Communications. We capped year proposing creation class tracking stock reflect economic performance AT&T Wireless Group. While Wireless Group remain part AT&T, separate tracking stock provide current shareowners future investors security tied directly performance business. As worked grow wireless businesses 1999, started putting bricks mortar broadband plans - key component growth strategy. We completed $52 billion merger Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) March, quickly accelerated upgrade TCI cable plant, enable develop additional revenue streams any-distance cable telephony, high-speed data, digital video. By end 1999, TCI, renamed AT&T Broadband, offering cable telephony 16 cities pilot markets, digital-video subscribers totaled approximately 1.8 million, 200,000 customers signed high-speed data service. To expand national cable network AT&T Broadband's systems, announced May $57 billion merger MediaOne. When merger completed 2000, significantly increase presence major metropolitan markets country owned operated cable systems passing 26 million homes. In addition accomplishments domestic growth initiatives, made significant progress global strategy. Most notably, launched Concert - leading global telecommunications company created AT&T's joint venture British Telecommunications plc (BT). Concert represents core global strategy began serving multinational business customers, international carriers Internet service providers January 2000. As part relationship Concert BT, made in-country facility-based investments 1999, including AT&T Canada Corp., Rogers Cantel Canada, Telecom. We completed purchase IBM Global Network Services provide data networking services businesses world AT&T Global Network Services (AGNS). [Included 1999 Annual Report pie charts entitled "Revenue Diversification Product." These charts depict revenue product 1998 1999.] <PAGE> In addition delivering domestic global strategic objectives 1999, achieved aggressive financial targets set year. We delivered revenue growth 6.2% pro forma basis acquisitions AT&T Broadband AGNS, hitting targeted range 5% 7%. The majority increase growth businesses, showing success investment strategy begins shift revenue base long distance voice revenue. Just year ago, long distance voice revenue 75% total revenue; 1999 dropped 62%. While long distance increasingly commodity, evidenced continued pricing pressures industry, current profitability supports investments growth businesses. These growth businesses turn support long distance business include long distance component bundle competitively priced services. In order competitive, low-cost provider industry, therefore, continuing efforts reduce cost structure. A year ago, committed reducing 1999 selling, general administrative (SG&A) expenses 23% revenue. We beat target, delivering SG&A expense-to-revenue ratio 21.7% year, translates approximately $830 million SG&A expense savings compared targets. The fourth quarter 21.2%. That's dramatic improvement 1997, SG&A expense-to-revenue ratio year 27.9%. While successful driving costs business, do. We continue attack costs committed cutting $2 billion costs end 2000 continuing streamline SG&A expenses lowering network costs moving data, voice wireless traffic expanding network global facilities. Not surprisingly, success growing revenue shrinking costs allowed deliver strong cash flow results 1999, cash operations growing $11.6 billion - 13.9% 1998. In 1999, generated $18.3 billion reported EBITDA [earnings, including income (expense), interest, taxes, depreciation amortization]. As anticipated, positive impact revenue growth cost controls earnings share offset impact shares issued franchise, goodwill purchased intangibles amortization investments acquisitions. As result, earnings diluted share 10.3% 1998. We undertook aggressive stock buyback program offset dilutive impacts acquisitions, half 1998 repurchased 220 million shares, cost approximately $10 billion. In 2000, plan repurchase 50 million shares Cox Communications, Inc., exchange cable properties cash. We've long 1999. As pages present detail, made solid progress strategy transform AT&T, delivered commitments growth expense control. There done, finished 1999 pride accomplishments confidence ability sustain momentum accelerate growth 2000. OVERVIEW AT&T world's communications leaders, providing voice, data video telecommunications services large small businesses, consumers government agencies. We provide domestic international long distance, regional, local wireless communications services, cable television Internet communication services. AT&T billing, directory calling-card services support communications business. <PAGE> MERGER TCI We completed merger TCI, renamed AT&T Broadband (Broadband), March 9, 1999, all-stock transaction valued approximately $52 billion. We issued approximately 664 million shares, 149 million treasury shares repurchased anticipation Broadband merger. The merger recorded purchase method accounting and, accordingly, results Broadband included financial results AT&T date acquisition. Periods prior merger restated include results Broadband. In connection transaction, issued separate tracking stock reflect economic performance Liberty Media Group (LMG), Broadband's programming technology investment businesses. We issued 1,140 million shares Liberty Media Group Class A tracking stock (including 60 million shares related conversion convertible notes) 110 million shares Liberty Media Group Class B tracking stock. We controlling financial interest Liberty Media Group financial accounting purposes; therefore, ownership LMG reflected investment accounted equity method AT&T consolidated financial statements. The amounts attributable LMG reflected separate line items "Equity losses Liberty Media Group" "Investment Liberty Media Group related receivables, net" accompanying consolidated financial statements. Broadband's cable operations, including ownership interest At Home Corporation (Excite@Home) Cablevision Systems Corp. (Cablevision), excluding LMG, combined existing operations AT&T form AT&T Common Stock Group (AT&T Group), economic performance represented AT&T common stock. References AT&T common stock include LMG tracking stock. Ownership shares AT&T common stock Liberty Media Class A B tracking stock represent direct legal interest assets liabilities groups, ownership AT&T total. Each shares represents interest economic performance net assets groups. Accordingly, earnings losses related LMG excluded earnings AT&T Group, earnings losses related AT&T Group excluded earnings LMG. Because account LMG equity investment, revenue, operating expenses, income (expense), interest expense provision taxes AT&T Group consolidated AT&T.

These charges represent payments carriers shared dedicated facilities switching equipment connect network networks. These costs declined $642 million, 4.2%, 1999 $1,022 million, 6.3%, 1998 compared prior year. These declines primarily driven mandated reductions per-minute access rates 1999 1998 lower international settlement rates resulting negotiations international carriers. Additionally, continue manage costs efficient network usage. These reductions partially offset volume growth, increased per-line charges (Primary Interexchange Carrier Charges) Universal Service Fund contributions. Since charges passed customer, per-minute access-rate reductions increases per-line charges Universal Service Fund generally resulted offsetting impact revenue. Broadband AGNS access interconnection expenses, results excluding Broadband AGNS. <PAGE> For Years Ended December 31, 1999 1998 1997 Dollars millions Network costs services $14,385 $10,495 $10,038 Network costs services expenses include costs operating maintaining networks, costs support outsourcing contracts, fees paid wireless carriers networks (off-network roaming), provision uncollectible receivables, programming licensing costs cable services, costs wireless handsets sold service-related costs. These costs increased $3,890 million, 37.1%, 1999 compared 1998, largely due Broadband AGNS acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, network costs increased $428 million, 4.1%, 1999, slight improvement compared 4.5% increase 1998. The growing wireless subscriber base primarily drove increase years, largely attributable success AT&T Digital One Rate service, resulted higher off-network roaming charges, costs handsets provision uncollectible receivables.

This increase due Broadband AGNS acquisitions. Excluding expenses, SG&A expenses declined $529 million, 4.2%. Reductions consumer long distance acquisition-program spending resulted lower marketing sales expenses. In 1999 continued efforts achieve best-in-class cost structure companywide cost-control initiatives, yielded improving cost structure. These decreases partially offset increased costs Wireless Services support growing subscriber base. SG&A expenses percent revenue 21.7% 1999, 24.0% 1998 27.9% 1997. We expect SG&A expenses percent revenue continue decline continue focus controlling expenses prioritizing spending. In addition, expect realize larger pension credit 2000 resulting higher pension trust asset base increase discount rate measure pension postretirement obligations. [Included 1999 Annual Report bar graph entitled "Cost Structure Improvements - SG&A Expenses Percent Revenue" showing SG&A expenses percent revenue quarters ended December 31, 1999.] SG&A expenses declined $1,601 million, 11.1%, 1998 compared 1997.

Franchise costs represent attributable agreement local authorities access homes Broadband's service areas. Other purchased intangibles arising business combinations primarily included customer lists licenses. In addition amortization goodwill reflected here, amortization goodwill nonconsolidated investments recorded component income (expense). This amortization totaled $495 million, $52 million $66 million 1999, 1998 1997, respectively. Net Restructuring Other Charges During 1999, recorded $1,506 million net restructuring charges, approximate $0.37 impact earnings diluted share. <PAGE> A $594 million in-process research development charge recorded reflecting estimated fair research development projects Broadband, date acquisition, reached technological feasibility alternative future use. The projects identified related Broadband's efforts offer voice IP, product-integration efforts advanced set-top devices, cost-savings efforts cable telephony implementation in-process research development related Excite@Home. We estimated fair in-process research development project income approach, adjusted allocate fair based project's percentage completion. Under approach, present anticipated future benefits projects determined discount rate 17%. For project, resulting net present multiplied percentage completion based effort expended date versus projected costs complete. The charge voice IP technology, voice telephony traffic digitized transmitted IP data packets, $225 million date acquisition. Current voice IP equipment support features required connect customer premises equipment traditional phone networks. Further technical development needed ensure voice quality comparable conventional circuit-switched telephony reduce power consumption IP telephony equipment. We anticipate test IP telephony equipment field deployment late 2000. The charge Broadband's product-integration efforts advanced set-top devices, enable offer next-generation digital services, $114 million date acquisition. The technology consists development integration work needed provide suite software tools run digital set-top box hardware platform. It anticipated field trials begin mid 2000 next-generation digital services. The charge Broadband's cost-savings efforts cable telephony implementation $101 million date acquisition. Telephony cost reductions primarily consist cost savings development "line power switch," Broadband cost effectively provide power customer telephony equipment cable plant. This device provide line-powered telephony burying cable line house. The device requires development order reach acceptable level reliability. We expect test deploy devices end 2000. Additionally, in-process research development charge related Excite@Home valued $154 million. During quarter 1999, ceased consolidate Excite@Home began account investment equity method accounting due corporate governance changes, resulted AT&T longer holding controlling financial interest. Accordingly, longer report in-process research development projects Excite@Home. <PAGE> Although significant technological issues overcome order successfully complete acquired in-process research development, expect successful completion. We estimate costs complete identified projects material impact results operations. If, however, unable establish technological feasibility produce commercially viable products/services, anticipated incremental future cash flows attributable expected profits products/services realized. A $531 million asset impairment charge primarily recorded association planned disposal wireless network equipment resulting program increase capacity operating efficiency wireless network. As part multivendor program, contracts executed vendors replace significant portions wireless infrastructure equipment western United States metropolitan New York markets. The program provide Wireless Services newest technology evolve new, third-generation digital technology, high-speed data capabilities.

LEGISLATIVE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS The Telecommunications Act 1996 designed foster local exchange competition establishing regulatory framework govern competitive entry local long distance telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Act permits Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) provide interexchange services originating state region demonstrating FCC provision public interest satisfying conditions developing local competition established Telecommunications Act. <PAGE> A number court decisions 1997 severely restricted implementation Telecommunications Act delayed local service competition. Recent rulings, however, upheld Telecommunications Act. Despite favorable rulings, assurance prices conditions established state provide effective local service entry competition provide AT&T market opportunities. In July 1997, United States Court Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated pricing rules FCC adopted implement sections local competition provisions Telecommunications Act applicable interconnection local exchange carrier (LEC) networks purchase unbundled network elements wholesale services LECs. In October 1997, Eighth Circuit vacated FCC Rule prohibited incumbent LECs separating network elements combined LECs' network, request competitor purchasing elements. These decisions increased difficulty costs providing competitive local service unbundled network elements purchased incumbent LECs. On December 31, 1997, U.S. District Court Northern District Texas issued memorandum opinion order holding Telecommunications Act's restrictions provision in-region, interLATA service RBOCs unconstitutional. AT&T carriers (collectively, "intervenors") filed appeal United States Court Appeals Fifth Circuit. On February 11, 1998, District Court suspended effectiveness December 31 memorandum opinion order pending appeal. On September 4, 1998, United States Court Appeals Fifth Circuit rejected arguments Telecommunications Act unconstitutional, reversed district court's contrary opinion. On December 22, 1998, United States Court Appeals District Columbia Circuit rejected similar challenge constitutionality Telecommunications Act. On January 19, 1999, United States Supreme Court denied petitions filed RBOCs review decision Fifth Circuit Court Appeals. On January 25, 1999, United States Supreme Court issued decision reversing Eighth Circuit Court Appeals' holding FCC lacks jurisdiction establish pricing rules applicable interconnection purchase unbundled network elements, Court Appeals' decision vacate FCC's rule prohibiting incumbent LECs separating network elements combined LECs' networks. The effect Supreme Court's decision reinstate FCC's rules governing pricing separation unbundled network elements. The Eighth Circuit Court Appeals incumbent LECs' claims FCC jurisdiction adopt pricing rules, rules adopted consistent applicable provisions Act. The Supreme Court vacated FCC's rule identifying defining unbundled network elements incumbent LECs required make entrants, directed FCC re-examine issue light standards mandated Telecommunications Act. <PAGE> In response Supreme Court's decision, FCC completed re-examination released order identifying defining unbundled network elements incumbent LECs required make entrants. That order readopted original list elements, exceptions. An association incumbent LECs appealed FCC's order United States Court Appeals District Columbia Circuit, asked Court hear appeal expedited basis. A number parties, including AT&T incumbent LECs, petitioned FCC reconsider and/or clarify order. The FCC moved hold appeal abeyance pending disposition reconsideration petitions. In view proceedings pending Eighth Circuit, D.C. Circuit, FCC state public utility commissions, assurance prices conditions established state provide effective local service entry competition provide AT&T market opportunities. In December 1999, Bell Atlantic obtained approval offer long distance telecommunications service New York State, time RBOC received approval Telecommunications Act. Bell Atlantic began offering combined local long distance service January 2000. In January 2000, SBC Communications, Inc., filed FCC application authorization offer long distance telecommunications service Texas. Under Telecommunications Act, FCC required issue decision application April 2000. COMPETITION AT&T faces significant competition expects level competition continue increase. The Telecommunications Act permits RBOCs provide interLATA interexchange services demonstrating FCC provision public interest satisfying conditions developing local competition established Telecommunications Act. The RBOCs petitioned FCC permission provide interLATA interexchange services states home markets; date FCC granted petition. In December 1999, Bell Atlantic RBOC obtain FCC approval provide long distance state home territory, New York. In January 2000, SBC Communications, Inc., applied FCC authorization provide long distance service Texas; law, FCC required rule application April 2000. To extent RBOCs obtain in-region interLATA authority Telecommunications Act's checklist conditions fully satisfactorily implemented adequate facilities-based local exchange competition exists, substantial risk AT&T interexchange service providers disadvantage RBOCs providing local service combined service packages. Because widely anticipated substantial numbers long distance customers seek purchase local, interexchange services single carrier part combined-or full-service package, competitive disadvantage, inability profitably provide local service competitive rates, delays limitations providing local service combined-service packages adversely affect AT&T's future revenue earnings. In addition, simultaneous entrance numerous competitors interexchange combined-service packages adversely affect AT&T's long distance revenue adversely affect earnings. <PAGE> SIX-YEAR SUMMARY SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED) AT&T Corp.
