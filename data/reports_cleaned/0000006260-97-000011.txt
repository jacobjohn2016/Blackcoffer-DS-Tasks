This balancing Company's industry strategy adheres paradigm Information Delivery Life Cycle, describes relationship age information, frequency speed access, type media information stored. In general, information ages, customer requirements frequency retrieval speed delivery decline. To achieve greatest degree cost-effectiveness efficiency, organizations migrate information delivery systems life information. <PAGE> (GRAPH AVAILABLE) Generally, newly created information frequently accessed, requiring high-speed storage media magnetic disk (i.e., DASD). As information begins age, migrated optical disk CD, offers high storage capacity quick access information lower cost DASD. As access information infrequent, information migrated magnetic tape, lower cost media slower, readily accessible, information delivery. Once information moves archival stage life cycle, migrated microfilm microfiche, offers low storage costs archival non-archival applications.
