LEGISLATIVE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS Telecommunications Act 1996 In February 1996, Telecommunications Act law. The Telecommunications Act, things, designed foster local exchange competition establishing regulatory framework govern competitive entry local long distance telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Act permit Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) provide interexchange services originating state region demonstrating FCC provision public interest satisfying conditions developing local competition established Telecommunications Act. In August 1996, FCC adopted rules regulations, including pricing rules (the "Pricing Rules") implement local competition provisions Telecommunications Act, including respect terms conditions interconnection LEC networks standards governing purchase unbundled network elements wholesale services LECs. These implementing rules rely state public utilities commissions (PUCs) develop specific rates procedures applicable states framework prescribed FCC. On July 18, 1997, United States Court Appeals Eighth Circuit issued decision holding FCC lacks authority establish pricing rules implement sections local competition provisions Telecommunications Act applicable interconnection LEC networks purchase unbundled network elements wholesale services LECs. Accordingly, Court vacated rules FCC adopted August 1996, stayed Court September 1996. On October 14, 1997, Eigth Circuit Court Appeals vacated FCC Rule prohibited incumbent LECs separating network elements combined <PAGE> LEC's network, request competitor purchasing elements. This decision increased difficulty costs providing competitive local service unbundled network elements purchased incumbent LECs. On January 25, 1999, Unites States Supreme Court issued decision reversing Eighth Circuit Court Appeal's holding FCC lacks jurisdiction establish pricing rules applicable interconnection purchase unbundled network elements, Court Appeal's decision vacate FCC's rule prohibiting incumbent LECs separating network elements combined LEC's network. The effect Supreme Court's decision reinstate FCC's rules governing pricing separation unbundled network elements. The pricing issues remanded Eighth Circuit Court Appeals incumbent LECs' claims FCC jurisdiction adopt pricing rules, rules adopted consistent applicable provisions Act. The Supreme Court vacated FCC's rule identifying defining unbundled network elements incumbent LECs required make entrants, directed FCC reexamine issue light standards mandated Act. In response Supreme Court's decision, FCC completed re-examination released order identifying defining unbundled network elements incumbent LECs required make entrants. That order re-adopted original list elements, exceptions. An association incumbent LECs appealed FCC's order United States Court Appeals District Columbia Circuit, asked Court hear appeal expedited basis. A number parties, including AT&T incumbent LECs, petitioned FCC reconsider and/or clarify order. The FCC moved hold appeal abeyance pending disposition reconsideration petitions. In July 2000, Eighth Circuit issued decision addressing incumbent LECs' claims FCC's pricing rules consistent applicable provisions Act. It rejected incumbent LECs' claims prices network elements based "historical costs" than, FCC held, "forward looking" costs. It held, however, FCC rule providing forward-looking costs calculated basis cost efficient alternatives contrary Act. The Eighth Circuit stayed ruling enable parties seek review Supreme Court, FCC's rules remain effect Supreme Court decides case. The Supreme Court agreed review Eighth Circuit's decision, decision Supreme Court anticipated end June 2002. The Supreme Court claim AT&T, FCC, Eighth Circuit erred invalidating FCC rule, claim incumbent LECs Eighth Circuit erred requiring prices based historical cost. The Eighth Circuit invalidated FCC's rules setting pricing methodology resold local services. That aspect decision stayed, reviewed Supreme Court. In view proceedings pending Supreme Court, DC Circuit, FCC state PUCs, assurance prices conditions established state provide effective local service entry competition provide AT&T market opportunities. The effect recent decision Eighth Circuit increase risks, costs, difficulties, uncertainty entering local markets <PAGE> incumbent LECs' facilities services. Notwithstanding substantial efforts, AT&T continues experience significant difficulty entering local markets. AT&T's ability purchase combined network elements ILECs, primary methods AT&T intends provide local service residential customers, continued severely hampered by, factors, ILEC-sponsored regulatory judicial actions, lack operating interfaces process network element orders ILECs. Despite strong customer demand competitive choice local markets AT&T's cable footprint, AT&T suspended sales resold local service, continues provide network element facilities-based local service New York Texas. AT&T continue regulatory efforts improve operating margins states offers non-facilities-based local services, seek open states competitive opportunities (both voice data services) improving rates, rules operating interfaces govern carrier relationships. In December 1999, Bell Atlantic (now Verizon) obtained approval offer long distance telecommunications service New York state, time RBOC received approval Telecommunications Act. Bell Atlantic began offering combined local long distance service January 2000. In July 2000, SBC Communications, Inc. RBOC receive approval, time state Texas, began providing combined local long distance service July 2000. In January 2001, FCC approved SBC Communications' request authority states Oklahoma Kansas, pursuant terms authority SBC free begin providing combined local long distance services states March 2001. In January 2001, Verizon filed application FCC authority state Massachusetts. This Verizon's filing state Massachusetts, FCC required issue decision application April 2001. Regulation Rates AT&T subject jurisdiction FCC respect interstate international rates, lines services, matters. From July 1989 October 1995, FCC regulated AT&T system "price caps" AT&T's prices, earnings, limited. On October 12, 1995, recognizing decade enormous change long distance market finding AT&T lacked market power interstate long distance market, FCC reclassified AT&T "non-dominant" carrier domestic interstate services. As result, AT&T subject regulations long distance competitors services. Thus, AT&T longer subject price cap regulation services, file tariffs presumed lawful day's notice, free regulations reporting requirements apply dominant carriers. In addition, October 31, 1996, FCC issued order prohibited non-dominant carriers, including AT&T, filing tariffs domestic interstate services. Non-dominant carriers, including AT&T, begun implementation mechanisms tariffs establish terms conditions apply domestic, interstate telecommunications services, August 1, 2001 mechanisms virtually domestic, interstate telecommunications services. In March 2001, FCC adopted order applying detariffing requirements international services. Furthermore, May 1997, FCC adopted orders relating Price Caps, Access Reform, Universal Service substantially revised level structure access charges AT&T long distance <PAGE> carrier pays incumbent LECs. Under Price Cap Order, LECs required reduce price cap indices 6.5 percent annually, adjustment inflation, resulted significant reductions access charges long distance companies pay LECs. The Access Reform Order permitted increased flat-rate assessments multiline business customers residential customers primary telephone line. AT&T agreed pass consumers savings AT&T result access charge reforms. Consequently, AT&T's results June 1997 reflect lower revenue minute usage lower access interconnection costs minute usage. In May 2000, FCC adopted CALLS Order price cap LECs made additional significant access price cap changes. The CALLS Order reduced $3.2 billion 2000 interstate access charges AT&T long distance carriers pay LECs access networks, established target access rates companies, years result reductions, albeit smaller magnitude. Once target rates reached, annual price reductions required Price Cap Order longer apply. In addition, CALLS Order removed implicit subsidies access charges converted explicit, portable subsidy administered part universal service program below. Also, CALLS, caps line-based costs vary usage increased costs increasingly recovered end user customers. These restructurings allowed reduction access charges assessed long distance carriers usage basis. As part CALLS Order, AT&T agreed flowthrough customers access charge reductions five-year life CALLS plan made commitments rate structure residential long distance offerings. Under August 1999 LEC Pricing Flexibility Order, affirmed D.C. Circuit February 2001, FCC established triggers enable price cap LECs obtain pricing flexibility interstates access services, including Phase relief permits remove services price cap regulation. Although triggers supposedly competitive presence sufficient constrain monopoly pricing LECs, fact, premature deregulation force access rates upwards. Finally, Universal Service Order, FCC adopted mechanism funding universal service, includes programs defray costs telephone service high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools, libraries rural health care providers. Specifically, FCC expanded set carriers contribute support universal service long distance carriers carriers, including LECs, provide interstate telecommunications services. Similarly, set carriers eligible universal service support expanded LECs eligible carrier providing local service customer, including AT&T entrant local markets. The Universal Service Order adopted measures provide discounts telecommunications services, Internet access inside wire eligible schools libraries telecommunications services rural health care providers. AT&T remains subject statutory requirements Title Communications Act. AT&T offer service rates, terms conditions just, reasonable unreasonably discriminatory; subject FCC's complaint process, give notice FCC affected customers prior discontinuance, reduction, impairment service. <PAGE> Commitments made AT&T address concerns raised declaring AT&T non-dominant satisfied expired. In addition matters respect Telecommunications Act, state public service commissions similar authorities regulatory power intrastate rates, lines services matters regulate AT&T's local intrastate communications services. The system regulation states rate-of-return regulation. In recent years, states adopted systems regulation, as: complete removal rate-of-return regulation, pricing flexibility rules, price caps incentive regulation. Wireless Regulatory Environment The FCC regulates licensing, construction, operation, acquisition, sale resale wireless systems United States pursuant Communications Act 1934 rules, regulations policies promulgated FCC. FCC terminology distinguishes "cellular" licenses, utilize frequency 850 megahertz, ""PCS" licenses, utilize frequency 1900 megahertz. The types licenses systems differing technical characteristics. Licensing wireless services systems AT&T Wireless Group owns protected geographic service area licenses granted FCC provide cellular service PCS. It owns licenses granted FCC provide point-to-multi-point communications services bands, including significant licenses 37 39 gigahertz bands. A cellular system operates 25 megahertz frequency blocks FCC allocates cellular radio service. Cellular systems generally two-way mobile voice applications, data applications fixed wireless services well. Cellular license areas issued metropolitan service areas rural service areas. Initially, cellular licenses metropolitan service area rural service area awarded local exchange telephone company FCC, license awarded competitive processes lotteries. Licenses issued beginning 1983, years numerous license transfers corporate reorganizations obscured original pattern distributing set licenses local telephone company affiliates companies local exchange service license area. A PCS system operates frequency blocks allocated personal communications services. PCS systems generally two-way voice applications carry two-way data communications well. For purpose awarding PCS licenses, FCC segmented United States 51 large regions called major trading areas, comprised 493 smaller regions called basic trading areas. The FCC awarded PCS licenses major trading area licenses basic trading area. The major trading area licenses authorize 30 megahertz spectrum. One basic trading area licenses 30 megahertz spectrum, 10 megahertz each. The FCC permits licensees split licenses assign portion, geographic frequency basis both, party. The FCC awarded initial PCS licenses auction. Auctions began 30 megahertz major trading area licenses concluded 1998 basic trading area licenses. However, March 1998, FCC adopted <PAGE> order allowed financially troubled entities won PCS 30 megahertz C-Block licenses auction obtain financial relief payment obligations return C-Block licenses FCC reauctioning. The FCC completed reauction returned licenses April 1999. In addition, C-block licenses bankruptcy proceedings. The FCC cancelled licenses, completed reauction licenses January 2001. The FCC's cancellation licenses challenged bankrupt licensees, guarantee reauction award licenses pursuant reauction affected challenge. Under FCC's current spectrum aggregation rules, entity hold attributable interests, generally 20% equity of, officer director position with, licensee, licenses 45 megahertz PCS, cellular specialized mobile radio services significant overlap geographic area. Significant overlap occur 10% population PCS licensed service area cellular and/or specialized mobile radio service area(s). The FCC recently increased limit 55 megahertz rural areas. These spectrum aggregation rules subject pending FCC proceeding revise eliminate them. All wireless licenses 10-year term, end term renewed. The FCC award renewal expectancy wireless licensee provided substantial service past license term, substantially complied applicable FCC rules policies Communications Act. Licenses revoked license renewal applications denied FCC determines renewal serve public interest. FCC rules provide competing renewal applications licenses considered comparative hearings, establish qualifications competing applications standards applied hearings. All wireless licenses satisfy coverage requirements. Cellular licenses required, years grant initial license, construct systems provide service (at signal strength) territory encompassed service area. Failure provide coverage resulted reduction relevant license area FCC. All A, B C block PCS licensees construct facilities offer coverage one-third population service area years initial license grants two-thirds population ten years. All D, E F block PCS licensees construct facilities offer coverage one-fourth population licensed area "make showing substantial service license area" years original license grants. Other point-to-multi-point licenses require showing substantial service renewal. Licensees fail meet coverage requirements subject forfeiture license. In effort balance competing interests existing microwave users PCS bands newly authorized PCS licensees, FCC adopted transition plan relocate microwave operators spectrum blocks cost sharing plan relocation incumbent benefits PCS licensee, licensees share cost relocation. The transition period contemplates negotiations microwave licensees PCS licensees accomplish transition govern terms conditions transition microwave licensees PCS spectrum. Generally, "voluntary" negotiation period incumbent microwave licensees can, negotiate PCS licensees. This "mandatory" negotiation period incumbent microwave licensees negotiate good faith PCS licensees. <PAGE> Wireless systems subject FAA regulations governing location, lighting construction transmitter towers antennas subject regulation federal environmental laws FCC's environmental regulations. State local zoning land regulations apply tower siting construction activities. We expect common carrier point-to-point microwave facilities connect wireless cell sites, link main switching office. The FCC licenses facilities separately subject regulation technical parameters service. The Communications Act preempts state local regulation entry of, rates charged by, provider private mobile radio service commercial mobile radio service, includes PCS cellular service. The FCC regulate commercial mobile radio service private mobile radio service rates. However, commercial mobile radio service providers common carriers required Communications Act offer services public unreasonable discrimination. The FCC's rules require providers permit resell services profit; however, rules expire 2002. Transfers assignments spectrum licenses Except transfers control assignments considered pro forma, Communications Act FCC rules require FCC's prior approval assignment license transfer control licensee PCS cellular system types wireless licenses. In addition, FCC established transfer disclosure requirements require licensees assign transfer control PCS license years license terms file sale contracts, option agreements, management agreements documents disclosing total consideration licensee receive return transfer assignment license. Non-controlling interests entity holds FCC license generally bought sold FCC approval subject FCC's spectrum aggregation limits. However, notification expiration earlier termination applicable waiting period Section 7A Clayton Act Federal Trade Commission Department Justice required sell acquire interests size. Approval state local regulatory authorities competent jurisdiction required circumstances. Foreign ownership Under existing law, 20% FCC licensee's capital stock owned, directly indirectly, voted non-U.S. citizens representatives, foreign government representatives foreign corporation. If FCC licensee controlled entity, case ownership structure, 25% entity's capital stock owned voted non-U.S. citizens representatives, foreign government representatives foreign corporation. Foreign ownership 25% level allowed FCC higher levels inconsistent public interest. The FCC ruled higher levels foreign ownership, 100%, presumptively consistent public interest respect investors nations. If foreign ownership exceed permitted level, FCC revoke FCC licenses, seek declaratory ruling FCC allowing foreign ownership actions reduce foreign ownership percentage order avoid loss licenses. We knowledge present foreign ownership violation restrictions. <PAGE> Recent regulatory developments The FCC announced rules making emergency 911 services cellular, PCS commercial mobile radio service providers, including enhanced 911 services provide caller's telephone number, location information. Commercial mobile radio service providers required actions enabling relay caller's automatic number identification location (initially location cell site transmitting call, ultimately approximation caller's actual location) requested public safety dispatch agency. Providers network handset-based technologies provide approximation caller's actual location. There requirement dispatch agencies reimburse provider costs deploying technologies. 911 service made users speech hearing disabilities, requirement apply providers digital wireless services 2002. Finally, wireless handsets capable receiving analog signals complete 911 calls strongest analog signal caller, caller subscribe carrier providing strongest signal. State actions incompatible FCC rules subject preemption FCC. On August 8, 1996, FCC released order implementing interconnection provisions Telecommunications Act. Although provisions order struck U.S. Court Appeals Eighth Circuit, January 25, 1999, U.S. Supreme Court reversed Eighth Circuit upheld FCC respects material operations. On June 10, 1999, Eighth Circuit issued order requesting briefs issues address earlier order, including pricing regime interconnection. While appeals pending, rationale FCC's order adopted states' public utility commissions, result charges cellular PCS operators pay interconnect traffic public switched telephone network declined significantly pre-1996 levels. In July 2000, Eighth Circuit rejected aspects FCC's pricing methodology, stayed order pending appeal affected parties U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed review case. In implementation Telecommunications Act, FCC established federal universal service requirements affect commercial mobile radio service operators. Under FCC's rules, commercial mobile radio service providers potentially eligible receive universal service subsidies time; however, required contribute federal universal service fund required contribute state universal funds. Many states moving forward develop state universal service fund programs. A number state funds require contributions, varying greatly state state, commercial mobile radio service providers. The FCC's universal service order modified appeal U.S. Court Appeals Fifth Circuit. The court's ruling effect reducing commercial mobile radio service provider support payments required federal universal service programs. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed address constitutionality FCC's universal service order, affects amount funds telephone companies entitled defray costs providing basic telephone service. The Court's determination affect FCC's interconnection pricing methodology. On August 1, 1996, FCC released report order expanding flexibility cellular, PCS commercial mobile radio service providers provide fixed mobile services. These fixed services include, <PAGE> limited to, wireless local loop services, example, apartment office buildings, wireless backup services private branch exchange switchboards local area networks, event interruptions due weather emergencies. If fixed services provided ancillary service carrier's mobility services, FCC decided fixed services regulated commercial mobile radio services. The FCC declined render prospective ruling fixed services provided co-primary basis mobility services regulated subjected universal service obligations. Rather, announced intention decide matters case-by-case basis depending characteristics provider's fixed service offering. The FCC presented case, ruled it. It unclear effect, any, ruling business AT&T Wireless Group. The FCC adopted rules telephone number portability enable customers migrate landline cellular telephone numbers cellular PCS providers cellular PCS provider service provider. On February 8, 1999, FCC extended deadline compliance requirement November 24, 2002, subject determination number portability conserve telephone numbers. The FCC adopted rules requiring cellular PCS providers provide functions facilitate electronic surveillance law enforcement officials June 30, 2000. Carriers provide additional surveillance capabilities September 30, 2001. AT&T Wireless Group sought permission flexible deployment schedule FCC. The FCC ruled request assurance FCC grant request. In addition, August 2000, U.S. Court Appeals District Columbia Circuit invalidated rules remanded FCC consideration. Various petitions pending FCC seeking suspension extensions deadlines applicable providing surveillance capabilities. It FCC revise rules extend compliance deadlines scope penalties failing comply be. In 1997, FCC determined rate integration requirement Communications Act applies interstate, interexchange services commercial mobile radio service providers. Rate integration requires carrier provide service continental U.S. offshore U.S. states territories rate structure applicable service points continental U.S. The FCC delayed implementation rate integration requirements respect wide area rate plans offer pending reconsideration rules. The FCC delayed requirement integrate commercial mobile radio service long distance rates commercial mobile radio service affiliates. On December 31, 1998, FCC reaffirmed, reconsideration, interexchange rate integration rules apply interexchange commercial mobile radio service services. The FCC announced initiate proceeding determine integration requirements apply typical commercial mobile radio service offerings, including one-rate plans. In July 2000, U.S. Court Appeals District Columbia Circuit reversed FCC's holding Communications Act unambiguously extends rate integration providers commercial mobile services. The court remanded matter FCC consideration. Pending conclusion proceeding, rate integration requirement apply commercial mobile services. To extent AT&T Wireless Group required offer services subject FCC's rate integration requirements, pricing flexibility reduced. We assure FCC decline impose rate integration requirements AT&T Wireless Group decline require integrate commercial mobile radio service long distance rates commercial mobile radio service affiliates. <PAGE> In 1998, FCC adopted rules limiting customer proprietary network information telecommunications carriers marketing broad range telecommunications services customers customers affiliated companies. The rules struck U.S. Court Appeals Tenth Circuit 1999, effectiveness stayed pending court's review petition FCC reconsideration. Even rules reinstated, AT&T Wireless Group anticipate result significant adverse impact financial position, results operation liquidity. State commissions increasingly aggressive efforts conserve numbering resources. Examples state conservation methods include: number pooling, number rationing code sharing. A number states petitioned FCC authority adopt "technology specific" overlays require wireless providers obtain telephone numbers separate area code require wireless providers change customers' telephone numbers. These efforts impact wireless service providers imposing additional costs limiting access numbering resources. The FCC adopted detailed billing rules landline telecommunications service providers applied number rules commercial mobile radio services providers. The FCC carriers decide pass mandatory universal service contributions customers required provide full explanation program, ensure carriers pass contribution recover amounts greater mandatory contributions customers. Adoption FCC's proposals increase complexity billing processes restrict ability bill customers services commercially advantageous way. The FCC adopted order determines obligations telecommunications carriers make services accessible individuals disabilities. The order requires telecommunications services providers offer equipment services accessible useable persons disabilities. While rules exempt telecommunications carriers meeting general disability access requirements results readily achievable, clear liberally FCC construe exemption. Accordingly, rules require make material network, product line, services expense. In June 1999, FCC initiated administrative rulemaking proceeding facilitate offering calling party pays optional wireless service. Under calling party pays service, party placing call wireless customer pays wireless airtime charges. Most wireless customers United States pay place calls receive them. Adoption calling party pays system widespread basis make commercial mobile radio service providers competitive traditional landline telecommunications providers provision regular telephone service. The FCC adopted rules standards methods evaluating radiofrequency emissions radio equipment, including network equipment handsets connection commercial mobile radio service. These rules upheld appeal U.S. Court Appeals Second Circuit. The U.S. Supreme Court declined review Second Circuit's ruling. AT&T Wireless Group's network facilities handsets sells customers comply standards. <PAGE> Media reports suggested radio frequency emissions wireless handsets linked health concerns, including incidence cancer. Although studies suggested radio frequency emissions biological effects, expert reviews conducted date concluded evidence support finding adverse health effects research appropriate. Earlier year, CTIA entered Cooperative Research Development Agreement sponsor research. Studies shown hand-held digital telephones interfere medical devices, including hearing aids pacemakers. The FDA recently issued guidelines wireless phones pacemaker wearers. Additional studies underway evaluate improve compatibility hearing aids digital wireless phones. State local regulation State local governments preempted regulating market entry by, rates of, wireless operators. However, state governments regulate terms conditions wireless service states imposed, proposed legislation impose, consumer protection regulations wireless industry. As noted above, States impose universal service support regimes wireless telecommunications carriers, similar requirements established FCC delegated authority FCC area number allocation administration. At local level, wireless facilities typically subject zoning land regulation. However, federal Telecommunications Act, local state governments categorically prohibit construction wireless facilities community unreasonably discriminate carrier. Numerous State local jurisdictions considered imposing conditions driver's wireless technology operating motor vehicle, so. Cable Regulation Legislation The operation cable television systems extensively regulated FCC, state governments local governments. The Telecommunications Act altered regulatory structure governing nation's telecommunications providers. It removes barriers competition cable television market local telephone market. Among things, reduces scope cable rate regulation. The Telecommunications Act required FCC implement numerous rulemakings, subject court challenges. Moreover, Congress FCC frequently revisited subject cable television regulation again. Future legislative regulatory adversely affect AT&T Broadband's operations. This section briefly summarizes key laws regulations affecting growth operation AT&T Broadband's cable systems. Cable Rate Regulation The 1992 Cable Act imposed extensive rate regulation regime cable television industry, limited ability cable companies increase subscriber fees. Under regime, cable systems subjected rate regulation, face "effective competition" local franchise area. Federal law defines "effective competition" community-specific basis requiring satisfaction conditions typically satisfied current marketplace. <PAGE> Although FCC establishes cable rate rules, local government units (commonly referred local franchising authorities "LFAs") primarily responsible administering regulation lowest level cable - basic service tier ("BST"), typically local broadcast stations access channels. Before LFA begins BST rate regulation, certify FCC follow applicable federal rules, LFAs voluntarily declined exercise authority. LFAs primary responsibility regulating cable equipment rates. Under federal law, charges types cable equipment unbundled monthly charges programming services, priced higher operator's actual cost, 11.25% rate return. The FCC historically administered rate regulation cable programming service tiers ("CPST"), typically satellite-delivered programming. Under Telecommunications Act, however, FCC's authority regulate CPST rates sunset March 31, 1999. Cable Entry Into Telecommunications The Telecommunications Act state local laws regulations prohibit effect prohibiting entity providing interstate intrastate telecommunications service. States authorized, however, impose "competitively neutral" requirements universal service, public safety welfare, service quality, consumer protection. State local governments retain authority manage public rights-of way. Although Telecommunications Act clarifies traditional cable franchise fees based revenues related provision cable television services, LFAs require reasonable, competitively neutral compensation management public rights-of-way cable operators provide telecommunications service." The Telecommunications Act prohibits LFAs requiring cable operators provide telecommunications service facilities condition franchise grant, renewal transfer, LFAs argue seek "institutional networks" part franchise negotiations. The favorable pole attachment rates afforded cable operators federal law increased utility companies owning poles year phase-in period beginning 2001 cable operator telecommunications service, cable service, plant. The FCC clarified cable operator's provision cable Internet service affect favorable pole rates, recent decision Eleventh Circuit Court Appeals disagreed suggested Internet traffic cable service telecommunications service leave cable attachments carry Internet traffic ineligible federal rate structure. This decision lead substantial increases pole attachment rates, utilities proposed vastly higher pole attachment rates based part existing court decision. The United States Supreme Court reviewing decision. The Eleventh Circuit mandate stayed pending Supreme Court action, variety cable operators, including AT&T Broadband, challenging increased pole attachment rates FCC. Cable entry telecommunications affected regulatory landscape fashioned FCC state regulators. One critical component Telecommunications Act intended facilitate entry telecommunications providers (including cable operators) interconnection obligation imposed telecommunications carriers. This requires, example, incumbent local telephone company competing telecommunications providers connect local telephone distribution system. A number implementation details subject ongoing regulatory judicial review, basic requirement established. <PAGE> Cable Systems Providing Internet Service Although present significant federal regulation cable system delivery Internet services, Federal Communications Commission recently issued reports finding impose regulation, situation change cable systems expand broadband delivery Internet services. In particular, proposals advanced Federal Communications Commission Congress require cable operators provide access unaffiliated Internet service providers online service providers. The Federal Trade Commission FCC recently imposed open access requirements Time Warner AOL connection merger, requirements applicable cable operators. Some states local franchising authorities imposition mandatory Internet access requirements part cable franchise renewals transfers. In June 2000, Ninth Circuit Court Appeals rejected attempt City Portland, Oregon impose mandatory Internet access requirements local cable operator. AT&T Broadband commenced technical operational trial test multiple Internet service providers offer high-speed, always-on cable Internet service hybrid fiber coaxial network. Telephone Company Entry Into Cable Television The Telecommunications Act telephone companies compete directly cable operators repealing historic telephone company/cable company cross-ownership ban FCC's video dial tone regulations. This LECs, including RBOCs, compete cable operators inside telephone service areas. Because resources, LECs formidable competitors traditional cable operators, LECs begun offering cable service. Under Telecommunications Act, LEC entity providing video programming customers regulated traditional cable operator (subject local franchising federal regulatory requirements), elects provide programming "open video system" ("OVS"). It anticipated primary benefit OVS regulatory model avoid obtain local franchise prior providing services. However, January 1999 federal court appeals decision held OVS providers required obtain franchise. To eligible OVS status, provider occupy one-third system's activated channels demand channels exceeds supply. Nor discriminate programmers establish unreasonable rates, terms conditions service. Although LECs cable operators expand offerings traditional service boundaries, general prohibitions remain LEC buyouts (i.e., ownership interest exceeding10 percent) co-located cable systems, cable operator buyouts co-located LEC systems, joint ventures cable operators LECs market. The Telecommunications Act limited exceptions buyout prohibition. Electric Utility Entry Into Telecommunications/Cable Television The Telecommunications Act registered utility holding companies subsidiaries provide telecommunications services, information services, services products subject jurisdiction FCCs notwithstanding public Utilities Holding Company Act. Electric utilities establish separate subsidiaries, "exempt telecommunications companies" apply FCC operating authority. Again, resources, electric utilities formidable competitors traditional cable systems. <PAGE> Cable Television Ownership Restrictions Pursuant 1992 Cable Act, FCC adopted regulations establishing 30% limit number multichannel video subscribers (including cable DBS subscribers) nationwide cable operator reach cable systems holds attributable interest, increase 35% additional cable systems minority controlled. The FCC stayed effectiveness ownership limits pending judicial review. The Federal Communications Commission directly addressed 30% ownership rule (and applicable ownership attribution standards) June 2000 ruling AT&T's merger MediaOne. The FCC allowed merger forward, required AT&T elect divestiture options compliance 30% ownership cap. Compliance (or arrangements compliance) required May, 2001. The FCC previously adopted regulations limiting carriage cable operator national programming services operator holds attributable interest 40% activated channels cable operator's systems. The rules provide additional channels 45% limit, whichever greater, provided additional channels carry minority controlled programming services. The regulations grandfather existing carriage arrangements exceed channel limits, require channel capacity devoted unaffiliated programming services system achieves compliance regulations. These channel occupancy limits apply to75 activated channels cable system, rules apply local regional programming services. In March, 2001, D.C. Circuit Court Appeals struck rules adopted FCC pertaining ownership programming carriage remanded issues back FCC review. The impact decision, including impact MediaOne Order, known. The Telecommunications Act eliminates statutory restrictions broadcast/cable cross-ownership (including broadcast network/cable restrictions), leaves place existing FCC regulations prohibiting local cross-ownership television stations cable systems. The Telecommunications Act leaves place existing restrictions cable cross-ownership SMATV MMDS facilities, lifts restrictions cable operator subject effective competition. In January 1995, however, FCC adopted regulations permit cable operators operate SMATV systems franchise area, provided operation consistent local cable franchise requirements. Must Carry/Retransmission Consent The 1992 Cable Act broadcast signal carriage requirements local commercial television broadcast stations elect years requiring cable system carry station ("must carry") negotiating payments granting permission cable operator carry station ("retransmission consent"). Less popular stations typically elect carry, popular stations typically elect retransmission consent. Must carry requests dilute appeal cable system's programming offerings, retransmission consent demands require substantial payments concessions (e.g. requirement cable system carry local broadcaster's affiliated cable programming service). Either option potentially adverse effect AT&T Broadband's business. The burden must-carry obligations dramatically increase television broadcast <PAGE> stations proceed planned conversions digital transmissions FCC determines cable systems carry simultaneously analog digital signals transmitted television stations multi-year transition single broadcast license authorized transmit analog digital signal. The FCC tentatively decided imposition dual digital analog carry January 2001 ruling. At time, however, initiated fact-gathering ultimately lead reconsideration tentative conclusion. Access Channels LFAs include franchise provisions requiring cable operators set channels non-commercial public, educational governmental ("PEG") access programming. Federal law requires cable system 36 channels designate portion activated channel capacity (up 15%) commercial leased access unaffiliated parties. The FCC adopted rules regulating terms, conditions maximum rates cable operator charge designated channel capacity, commercial leased access channels limited. "Anti-Buy Through" Provisions Federal law requires cable system permit customers purchase premium pay-per-view video programming offered operator per-channel per-program basis necessity subscribing tier service (other basic service tier) system's lack addressable converter boxes technological limitations permit so. The statutory exemption cable systems technological capability comply expires October 2002, FCC extend period deemed necessary. Access Programming To spur development independent cable programmers competition incumbent cable operators, 1992 Cable Act imposed restrictions dealings cable operators cable programmers. Of special significance competitive business posture, 1992 Cable Act precludes satellite video programmers affiliated cable operators favoring cable operators competing multichannel video programming distributors (such DBS MMDS distributors). This provision limits ability vertically integrated satellite cable programmers offer exclusive programming arrangements AT&T Broadband. Both Congress FCC considered proposals expand program access rights cable's competitors, including possibility subjecting terrestrially delivered video programming video programmers affiliated cable operators program access requirements. Pursuant Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, FCC adopted regulations governing retransmission consent negotiations broadcasters multichannel video programming distributors, including cable DBS. Inside Wiring; Subscriber Access Federal Communications Commission rules require incumbent cable operator expiration multiple dwelling unit service contract sell, abandon, remove "home run" wiring installed cable operator multiple dwelling unit building. These inside wiring rules expected assist building owners attempts replace existing cable operators programming providers pay building owner <PAGE> higher fee, fee permissible. The Federal Communications Commission proposed abrogating exclusive multiple dwelling unit service agreements held incumbent operators, allowing contracts held entrants. In proceeding, Federal Communications Commission preempted restrictions deployment private antenna rental property exclusive tenant, balconies patios. This Federal Communications Commission ruling limit extent multiple dwelling unit owners enforce aspects multiple dwelling unit agreements prohibit, example, placement digital broadcast satellite receiver antennae multiple dwelling unit areas exclusive occupancy renter. These developments make difficult AT&T Broadband provide service multiple dwelling unit complexes. Other Regulations Federal Communications Commission In addition Federal Communications Commission regulations noted above, regulations Federal Communications Commission covering areas as: equal employment opportunity (currently suspended result judicial ruling), subscriber privacy, programming practices, including, things: (1) syndicated program exclusivity, requires cable system delete programming offered distant broadcast signal carried system duplicates programming local broadcast station secured exclusive distribution rights, (2) network program nonduplication, (3) local sports blackouts, (4) indecent programming, (5) lottery programming, (6) political programming, (7) sponsorship identification, (8) children's programming advertisements, (9) closed captioning, registration cable systems facilities licensing, maintenance records public inspection files, aeronautical frequency usage, lockbox availability, antenna structure notification, tower marking lighting, consumer protection customer service standards, technical standards, consumer electronics equipment compatibility, emergency alert systems. The Federal Communications Commission recently ruled cable customers allowed purchase cable converters parties established multi-year phase-in security functions, remain operator's exclusive control, unbundled basic converter functions, satisfied party vendors. The phase implementation date July 1, 2000. Compliance technically operationally difficult locations, AT&T Broadband cable operators filed request FCC requirement waived systems. The request resulted temporary deferral compliance deadline systems. <PAGE> The FCC recently initiated inquiry determine cable industry's future provision interactive services subject regulations ensuring equal access competition service vendors. The inquiry, grew Commission's review AOL-Time Warner merger, earliest stages. The Federal Communications Commission authority enforce regulations imposition substantial fines, issuance cease desist orders and/or imposition administrative sanctions, revocation Federal Communications Commission licenses needed operate transmission facilities connection cable operations. Copyright Cable television systems subject federal copyright licensing covering carriage television radio broadcast signals. In exchange filing reports contributing percentage revenue federal copyright royalty pool (such percentage varies depending size system number distant broadcast television signals carried), cable operators obtain blanket permission retransmit copyrighted material broadcast signals. The modification elimination compulsory copyright license subject continuing review adversely affect AT&T Broadband's ability obtain desired broadcast programming. In addition, cable industry pays music licensing fees Broadcast Music, Inc. American Society Composers, Authors Publishers. Copyright clearances nonbroadcast programming services arranged private negotiations. State Local Regulation Cable television systems generally operated pursuant nonexclusive franchises granted municipality state local government entity. The Telecommunications Act clarified entity providing cable services obtain local franchise depends solely entity crosses public rights way. Federal law prohibits franchise authorities granting exclusive franchises unreasonably refusing award additional franchises covering existing cable system's service area. Cable franchises generally granted fixed terms cases terminable franchisee fails comply material provisions. Non-compliance cable operator franchise provisions result monetary penalties. The terms conditions franchises vary materially jurisdiction jurisdiction. Each franchise generally provisions governing cable operations, service rates, franchise fees, system construction maintenance obligations, system channel capacity, design technical performance, customer service standards, indemnification protections. A number states subject cable television systems jurisdiction centralized state governmental agencies. Although LFAs considerable discretion establishing franchise terms, federal limitations. For example, LFAs insist franchise fees exceeding 5% system's gross revenue, dictate technology system, video programming identifying broad categories programming. Federal law renewal procedures designed protect incumbent franchisees arbitrary denials renewal. Even franchise <PAGE> renewed, franchise authority seek impose onerous requirements significant upgrades facilities services increased franchise fees funding channels condition renewal. Similarly, franchise authority's consent required purchase sale cable system franchise, authority attempt impose burdensome onerous franchise requirements connection request consent. Historically, franchises renewed cable operators provided satisfactory services complied terms franchises. Proposed Changes Regulation The regulation cable television systems federal, state local levels subject political process constant flux past decade. Material law regulatory requirements anticipated assurance AT&T Broadband's business affected adversely future legislation, regulation deregulation. COMPETITION Competition long distance local telecommunications services based price pricing plans, types services offered, customer service, access customer premises, communications quality, reliability availability, as, business customers, ability provide high quality data communication services technical support. AT&T's principal competitors include MCIWorldcom, Inc., Sprint Corporation, RBOCs GTE Corporation. AT&T experiences significant competition long distance number newer entrants, Qwest, large number smaller entities, including dial resellers. In addition, long distance telecommunications providers facing competition non-traditional sources, including result technological substitutions, Internet telephony, e-mail, wireless services. The ILECs substantial capital resources, long standing customer relationships extensive existing facilities network rights-of-way AT&T's primary competitors local services market. Additionally, number long distance telecommunication, wireless, cable service providers entered local services market competition AT&T. Some actual potential competitors substantial financial resources. AT&T competes local services market number CLECs, existing local networks significant financial resources. Competition subscribers wireless service providers based principally services features offered, call quality, customer service, system coverage price. AT&T Wireless Group's ability compete successfully depend, part, ability anticipate respond competitive factors affecting industry, including services introduced, consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions pricing strategies. Increased competitive pressures, introduction popularity products services, including prepaid phone products, general softening economy, adversely affect results, increase churn decrease average revenue user. AT&T Wireless Group's primary national competitors Cingular, Verizon Wireless, Nextel Communications, Inc., VoiceStream Communications Sprint PCS. <PAGE> In addition, wireless communications industry experiencing significant consolidation AT&T Wireless Group expects consolidation continue. The previously announced, recently completed, mergers joint ventures Bell Atlantic/GTE/Vodafone AirTouch (now called Verizon), SBC/Bell South/Ameritech (now called Cingular) created large, well-capitalized competitors substantial financial, technical, marketing resources respond AT&T Wireless Group's offerings. In addition, July 2000, VoiceStream Communications Deutsche Telekom announced proposed transaction. These mergers ventures caused AT&T Wireless Group's ranking decline U.S. revenue U.S. subscriber share. In terms U.S. population covered licenses, POPs, AT&T Wireless Group, including partnerships affiliates, ranks third. As result, competitors offer nationwide services plans quickly economically AT&T Wireless Group obtain roaming rates favorable obtained AT&T Wireless Group, respond offers AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T Wireless Group's cellular operations experienced direct competition cellular licensee market. Beginning 1997, AT&T Wireless Group began experiencing competition license holders markets. Competition providers AT&T Wireless Group's markets continue increase networks license holders built years. In addition, FCC offer additional spectrum wireless mobile licenses future existing technologies. Cable television competes customers local markets providers entertainment, news information. The competitors markets include broadcast television radio, newspapers, magazines printed material, motion picture theatres, video cassettes sources information entertainment including directly competitive cable television operations internet service providers. The Cable Acts designed increase competition cable television industry. There alternative methods distributing similar video programming offered cable television systems. These include direct broadcast satellite, DBS, (allowing subscriber receive video services directly satellite small dish), telephone networks (whether wireless cable, upgraded telephone networks), utility company networks, MMDS (which deliver programming services microwave channels received customers special antennas), competitive, non-exclusive franchises, city provided cable services, SMATV systems (which provide multichannel program services directly hotel, motel, apartment, condominium similar multi-unit complexes cable television system's franchise area, generally free regulation state local governmental authorities). In addition competition customers, cable television industry competes broadcast television, radio, print media sources information entertainment advertising revenue. Additionally, AT&T Broadband begins offer services high speed Internet access telephone services, significant competition local telephone companies providers services. DBS emerged significant competition cable systems. The DBS industry grown rapidly years, exceeding growth rate cable television industry, serves approximately 14 million subscribers nationwide DBS companies historically prohibited retransmitting popular local broadcast programming, change existing copyright laws November 1999 eliminated legal impediment. DBS companies secure retransmission consent popular broadcast stations <PAGE> carry, face mandatory carriage obligations popular broadcast stations January 2002. In response legislation, DirecTV, Inc. EchoStar Communications Corporation begun carrying major network stations nation's top television markets. DBS, however, limited local programming provide current capacity limitations satellite technology. It is, therefore, expected DBS companies offer local broadcast programming larger U.S. markets foreseeable future. The DBS industry recently initiated judicial challenge statutory requirement mandating carriage popular broadcast stations. This lawsuit alleges carry requirement (similar applicable cable systems) unconstitutional. EchoStar began providing high-speed Internet access late 2000, DirecTV, partnered AOL, reports begin providing version high-speed Internet access shortly. These developments provide significant competition AT&T Broadband's offering high speed Internet access. AT&T faces significant competition expects level competition continue increase. As competitive, regulatory technological occur, including occasioned Telecommunications Act, AT&T anticipates competitors enter expand positions communications services markets. These include entrants segments communications information services industry global competitors seeking expand market opportunities. Many competitors enter strong market presence, recognized names pre-existing direct customer relationships. The Telecommunications Act significant impact competitive environment. Anticipating industry, non-RBOC LECs, required implement Telecommunications Act's competitive checklist prior offering long distance home markets, integrated local service offerings long distance offerings advance AT&T offering combined local long distance service areas, continue adversely affect AT&T's revenues earnings service regions. In addition, Telecommunications Act permits RBOCs provide interLATA interexchange services demonstrating FCC provision public interest, satisfied conditions developing local competition established Telecommunications Act. The RBOCs petitioned FCC permission provide interLATA interexchange services states home market; date FCC granted petitions. In December 1999, Verizon RBOC obtain approval provide long distance state home territory, New York. The FCC authorized SBC Communications, Inc.'s Texas application April 2000. More recently, February 2001, FCC approved SBC applications Kansas Oklahoma. To extent RBOCs obtain in-region interLATA authority Telecommunications Act's checklist conditions fully satisfactorily implemented adequate facilities-based local exchange competition exists, substantial risk AT&T interexchange service providers disadvantage RBOCs providing local service combined service packages. Because widely anticipated substantial numbers long distance customers seek purchase local, interexchange services single carrier part combined full service package, competitive disadvantage, inability profitably provide local service competitive rates delays limitations providing local service combined service packages <PAGE> adversely affect AT&T's future revenue earnings. In event, simultaneous entrance numerous competitors interexchange combined service packages adversely affect AT&T's future long distance revenue adversely affect future earnings. In addition, substitution data Internet services voice services depress earnings smaller margin services contain. Furthermore, February 1997, General Agreement Trade Services (GATS) reached World Trade Organization. The GATS, effective January 1, 1998, designed open country's domestic telecommunications markets foreign competitors. The GATS, future trade agreements, accelerate entrance U.S. market foreign telecommunications providers, possess dominant home market positions effective competition. The GATS permit AT&T's entrance markets small number countries refused eliminate foreign ownership restrictions. In addition matters referred above, factors, including technological hurdles, market acceptance, start-up ongoing costs provision services local conditions obstacles, adversely affect timing success AT&T's entrance local exchange services market AT&T's ability offer combined service packages include local service. EMPLOYEES At December 31, 2000 AT&T employed approximately 166,000 persons operations, approximately 97% located domestically. About 22% domestically located employees AT&T represented unions. Of represented, 94% represented Communications Workers America (CWA), affiliated AFL-CIO; 5% International Brotherhood Electrical Workers (IBEW), affiliated AFL-CIO. In addition, small remainder domestic employees represented unions. Labor agreements unions extend May 2002. Of AT&T's employees, approximately 29,000 persons employed AT&T Wireless Group operations, virtually located United States.

In units, AT&T faces competition numerous national regional domestic international companies, advantages AT&T. Competitive conditions impose variety significant challenges including pressures require future price cuts affect desirability products services. These conditions create risk market share loss risk customers shift profitable, lower margin services. Competitive pressures create challenges AT&T's ability grow businesses introduce services successfully execute business plan, including, significantly, ability purchase fairly priced access services. Each business units faces risk potential price cuts competitors materially adversely affect market share margins. We sustain existing price margin levels. These business units face risk increasing competition entities access facilities, including entities access facilities vast regions United States ability control cost, cycle time, functionality end-to-end services regions. These entities preserve large market share high margins access services enter markets, including long distance end-to-end services. This places superior position vis-a-vis AT&T competitors purchase high margin access services. Additionally, business units initiate price cuts order seek retain market share seek slow decline market share. The cost structure AT&T's business units affects competitiveness. Each business units faces risk maintain competitive cost structure newer technologies favor newer competitors legacy infrastructure technology substitution continues. Each units' ability make critical investments improve cost structure impaired AT&T's current significant debt obligations. Broadband Services AT&T faces competitive risks Broadband Services business. These risks include growth satellite services, regional bell operating companies services and/or companies providing digital subscriber lines compete directly customers markets. They include emergence combinations, AOL Time Warner, seek commoditize cable access provide differentiated product, escalating costs programming areas materially adversely affect margins. In addition, AT&T's Broadband Services business faces risks relating acceptance costs potential services. The regulatory legislative environment creates challenges AT&T's business units <PAGE> Communications Services Each AT&T's consumer business communications services business units faces risk impact implementation current regulations legislation, unfavorable regulation introduction onerous regulation. These risks include impact following: current law implemented manner allowed effective entry local markets due non-competitive pricing access local service regional bell operating company systems permit rapid large-scale customer regional bell operating companies service providers, AT&T faces head-on competition regional bell operating companies begin enter long distance business. At present, AT&T market entry rules applied enforced economic viability local market access alternatives effective large scale management customers. Further, facilities-based competitors regional bell operating companies emerged significant alternate source supply access local services. One consequence AT&T remains ultimately dependent regional bell operating companies supply regional bell operating companies represent substantially access control, cost cycle times, functionality. This dependency supply adversely impacts AT&T's cost structure ability create market desirable competitive end-to-end products customers. Absent effective application rules regulations, regional bell operating companies well-positioned deter entrants local service. In addition, regional bell operating companies entering long distance business control substantially access facilities regions. This result increased level competition long distance end-to-end services services offered regional bell operating companies expand. Broadband Services In case broadband services, possibility forced open access cable plant resulting commodization high-speed data cable materially adversely affect AT&T's business. Also, cable regulation pricing, ownership limitations matters impede growth raise costs. New Legislation regulation increase competition In addition, possibility regulations legislation erode rules apply largest competitor suppliers, including regional bell operating companies. These give companies streamlined regulations apply access services. These exclude services, so-called "advanced" data services, market-opening rules applicable legislation. The consequences accelerate head-on competition AT&T regional bell operating companies communications services broadband units. <PAGE> AT&T adversely affected increased debt levels AT&T pursuing measures seek reduce debt level. However, efforts completed successfully levels, terms time frame contemplated, AT&T's liquidity increase result revenue margin deterioration, AT&T's financial condition materially adversely affected. AT&T materially adversely affected weakening market corporate credit ratings downgrades. AT&T's current debt level materially adversely affect company business units impairing financial flexibility, ability pursue acquisitions make capital expenditures impacting investment decisions materially impair unit's growth ability compete. AT&T obtain financing terms acceptable it. AT&T's debt ratings review rating agencies. As result review, AT&T's ratings downgraded and/or put credit watch negative outlook. These actions result increased cost future borrowings limit access financing. AT&T's failure complete restructuring plan contemplated impact liquidity. At December 31, 2000, AT&T total indebtedness approximately $65 billion, short term portion $31.9 billion. AT&T's ability meet obligations depend credit ratings, market conditions business results. AT&T continues investigate negotiate financing alternatives including monetization publicly held securities, sales non-strategic assets investments, securitization accounts receivable, $6.5 billion debt offering AT&T Wireless Services quarter 2001. AT&T increased $10 billion line credit $25 billion, subsequently reduced $18.4 billion DoCoMo investment AT&T Wireless Services debt offering. In addition, AT&T plans retire portion short-term debt part funds planned 2001 offering security intended reflect financial performance economic AT&T's Broadband unit, offering occur expected. AT&T adversely affected ratings downgrades AT&T's senior debt ratings short-term debt ratings reduced late 2000 Standard & Poor's Rating Services A andA1; Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A2 andP1; Fitch, Inc. A-and F1. Both AT&T's short-term long-term ratings remain review downgrade Standard & Poor's Moody's Investors Service. Late year, AT&T initiated debt reduction plan, continued make progress. However, time, AT&T deterioration results core communication services businesses. It unclear rating agencies balance developments ratings assessment, material risk AT&T downgraded. We expect review rating agencies future financial results long-term financial projections AT&T businesses separated. A ratings action occur advance meetings, meeting period, meetings. If AT&T downgraded, access capital disrupted cost capital increase. AT&T access commercial paper market today sufficient satisfy short-term borrowing needs. In event short-term rating downgrade <PAGE> downgrades, level issuance capacity AT&T contract exceeded short-term borrowing needs. In case, AT&T access $25 billion bank credit facility put place December 28, 2000 serve commercial paper back-up source liquidity. The $25 billion bank credit facility reduced $18.3 billion March 2001 made progress deleveraging efforts. The cost short-term borrowing bank facility higher cost commercial paper borrowings AT&T today, higher depending market conditions. In addition, access bank facility extends December 28, 2001 reduced low $10 billion continue make progress deleveraging efforts. To extent combined outstanding short-term borrowings bank credit facility AT&T's commercial paper program exceed market capacity borrowings expiration bank credit facility, AT&T's continued liquidity depend ability reduce short-term debt combination capital market borrowings, asset sales, operational cash generation, capital expenditure reduction means. Our ability achieve objectives subject risk execution execution materially impact AT&T's operational results. In addition, cost capital market financing significantly excess AT&T's historical financing costs. Also, AT&T suffer negative banking, investor, public relations repercussions draw bank facility, intended serve back-up source liquidity only. Such impacts deterioration cost access capital. Furthermore, terms bank credit facility, AT&T's ability split AT&T Wireless Group contingent AT&T's senior debt rating, determined Standard Poor's Moody's Investors Service, falling BBB+ Baa1, respectively. Failure split AT&T Wireless Group early 2002 permit NTT DoCoMo elect require AT&T repurchase interest AT&T aggregate purchase price $9.8 billion predetermined rate interest, limit availability increase cost financing. AT&T attract retain management AT&T's business units face risks, including risks related difficulties attracting, retaining motivating key employees, consumer business communications services units.

Amortization goodwill, franchise costs purchased intangibles increased $1.1 billion 1999 compared 1998 due primarily acquisition TCI and, lesser extent, AGNS. <TABLE> <CAPTION> For Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 ---- ---- ---- Dollars millions <S> <C> <C> <C> Net restructuring charges....................................... $7,029 $1,506 $2,514 </TABLE> <PAGE> During 2000, recorded $7.0 billion net restructuring charges, approximate $0.90 earnings diluted share impact AT&T Common Stock Group. The 2000 charge included $6.2 billion asset impairment charges related Excite@Home, $759 million restructuring exit costs AT&T's initiative reduce costs, $91 million related government-mandated disposition AT&T Communications (U.K.) Ltd., competed directly Concert. The asset impairment charges related Excite@Home resulted deterioration market conditions market valuations Internet-related companies fourth quarter 2000, caused Excite@Home conclude intangible assets related acquisitions Internet-related companies recoverable. Accordingly, Excite@Home conducted detailed assessment recoverability carrying amounts acquired intangible assets. This assessment resulted determination acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, related acquisitions, including Excite, impaired December 31, 2000. As result, Excite@Home recorded impairment charges $4.6 billion December 2000, representing excess carrying amount impaired assets fair value. The impairment allocated asset group based comparison carrying values fair values. The impairment write-down asset group allocated goodwill, goodwill reduced zero, identifiable intangible assets proportion carrying values. Since approximately 23% Excite@Home, 77% charge recorded Excite@Home included reduction AT&T's net income, eliminated 2000 Consolidated Statement Income "Minority interest income (expense)." Also result foregoing, AT&T recorded goodwill acquisition-related impairment charge $1.6 billion acquisition investment Excite@Home. The write-down investment fair determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows. The $759 million charge restructuring exit plans primarily due headcount reductions, network operations Business Services, including consolidation customer-care call centers, synergies created MediaOne merger. Included exit costs $503 million cash termination benefits separation approximately 7,300 employees part voluntary involuntary termination plans. Approximately one-half separations management employees one-half nonmanagement employees. Approximately 6,700 employee separations related involuntary terminations approximately 600 voluntary terminations. We recorded $62 million network lease contract termination costs penalties incurred part notifying vendors termination contracts year, net losses $32 million related disposition facilities primarily due synergies created MediaOne merger. Also included restructuring exit costs 2000 $144 million benefit plan curtailment costs employee separations part exit plans. Further, recorded asset impairment charge $18 million related write-down unrecoverable assets businesses carrying longer supported estimated future cash flows. <PAGE> The 2000 restructuring initiatives projected yield cash savings approximately $690 million year, EBIT (earnings interest taxes, including pretax minority interest net pretax losses equity investments) savings approximately $700 million year. We expect increased spending growth businesses largely offset cash EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable reduced personnel-related expenses, realized SG&A expenses costs services products. During 1999, recorded $1.5 billion net restructuring charges, approximate $0.37 earnings diluted share impact AT&T Common Stock Group. A $594 million in-process research development charge recorded reflecting estimated fair research development projects TCI, date acquisition, reached technological feasibility alternative future use.

The technology consists development integration work needed provide suite software tools run digital set-top box hardware platform. It anticipated field trials begin late-2001 next-generation digital services. The charge cost-savings efforts broadband-telephony implementation $101 million date acquisition. Telephony cost reductions primarily consist cost savings development "line power switch," cost effectively provide power customer telephony equipment cable plant. This device provide line-powered telephony burying cable line house. Trials related telephony cost reductions complete, implementation begun markets. Additionally, in-process research development charge related Excite@Home valued $154 million. This charge related projects self-provisioning devices development next-generation client software, network back-office infrastructure enable variety network devices personal computers improved design regional data centers' infrastructure. <PAGE> Although technological issues overcome successfully complete acquired in-process research development, expect successful completion. We estimate costs complete identified projects material impact results operations. If, however, unable establish technological feasibility produce commercially viable products/services, anticipated incremental future cash flows attributable expected profits products/services realized. A $531 million asset impairment charge recorded 1999 planned disposal wireless communications equipment resulting program increase capacity operating efficiency wireless network. As part multivendor program, contracts executed select vendors replace significant portions wireless infrastructure equipment western United States metropolitan New York markets. The program intended provide Wireless Services newest technology evolve new, next-generation digital technology, designed provide high-speed data capabilities. Since assets remain service date decision dispose assets disposal date, remaining net book assets depreciated period. Also 1999, $145 million charge restructuring exit costs recorded part AT&T's initiative reduce costs.

Approximately one-half separations management employees one-half nonmanagement employees. Approximately 1,700 employee separations related involuntary terminations approximately 1,100 voluntary terminations. The 1999 restructuring initiatives projected yield cash savings approximately $250 million year. This restructuring yielded EBIT savings approximately $200 million 2000, expected save $400 million year thereafter. We expect increased spending growth businesses largely offset cash EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable reduced personnel-related expenses, realized SG&A expenses costs services products. We recorded net losses $307 million related government-mandated disposition international businesses competed directly Concert, $50 million related contribution agreement Broadband entered Phoenixstar, Inc. That agreement requires Broadband satisfy liabilities owed Phoenixstar subsidiaries. The remaining obligation contribution agreement agreement MediaOne $57 million, fully accrued December 31, 2000. In addition, recorded benefits $121 million related settlement pension obligations employees accepted AT&T's 1998 voluntary retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer. During 1998, recorded $2.5 billion net restructuring charges, approximate $0.59 earnings diluted share impact AT&T Common Stock Group. The bulk charge cost-reduction program approximately 15,300 management employees accepted VRIP offer. A restructuring charge $2,724 million composed <PAGE> $2,254 million $169 million pension postretirement special-termination benefits, respectively, $263 million benefit plan curtailment losses $38 million administrative costs. We recorded charges $125 million related facility costs $150 million executive-separation costs. These charges partially offset benefits $940 million settled pension benefit obligations 13,700 total VRIP employees. In addition, VRIP charges partially offset reversal $256 million 1995 business restructuring reserves primarily resulting overlap VRIP 1995 projects.
