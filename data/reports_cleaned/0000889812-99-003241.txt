Recognizing dependent entire company IT, Company decided 1997 replace primary business applications uniform international business accounting information system address systems applications listed improve internal reporting processes. Based representations manufacturer current version uniform information system Year 2000 ready, Company actively upgrading business sites utilize uniform system Year 2000 ready version. In addition pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations utilized earlier non-Year 2000 ready version uniform business accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee, Health-o-Meter, Sunbeam Latin America replacing current non-Year 2000 ready systems uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe replacing key business components system.

For example, Coleman approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs lieu Sunbeam's uniform business accounting information system remediated tested Year 2000 ready. With respect Company's non-IT systems, including time attendance, security, in-line manufacturing hardware, Company actively analyzing items assess Year 2000 issues. To date, material issues discovered, Company continue review, test correct, necessary, items. The Company largely implemented corrective work expects complete final testing implementation systems quarter early fourth quarter 1999. Phase 3--Customers, Suppliers Business Partners. The phase Company's Year 2000 readiness program initiated fourth quarters 1998 designed assess interact Company's customers, suppliers, business partners. As part effort, Company surveyed 1,100 vendors suppliers, portion provide initial response. During months 1999, "high risk" vendors contacted directly number non-respondents 50 <PAGE> decreased substantially.

Furthermore, Company process contacting alternate vendors Year 2000 ready replace critical vendors deemed "high risk" event vendors found Year 2000 ready. The Company independently verified responses vendors anticipate undertaking independent verification process. Beginning quarter 1999, Company began contacting major customers confirm preparations Year 2000 issues. Sunbeam responded numerous customer inquiries believes Company's major customers established programs deal Year 2000 issues. In order improve Company's communication customers, suppliers business partners, Company set Sunbeam Year 2000 telephone number process providing Year 2000 information Company web site.

The Risks Sunbeam's Year 2000 Approach The independent consultants assisting Company Year 2000 readiness program reviewed concurred Company's approach, assisted developing cost estimates monitored costs largest single component (upgrade installation Company's uniform system) Company's Year 2000 program. Since Company's Year 2000 program developed monitored independent consultants, Company engage independent party verify program's approach total cost; based this, Company believes Company's exposure regard mitigated. In addition, external third-party diagnostic software packages designed analyze Year 2000 readiness business software programs, Company identify potential Year 2000 issues Coleman. Given this, Company believes mitigated risk validating verifying key program components.

At time, Company believes "worst-case" scenario relating Year 2000 involves potential disruptions areas Company's operations rely parties, suppliers, systems work properly January 1, 2000. While system failures directly indirectly affect important operations Company subsidiaries significant manner, Company present estimate likelihood potential cost failures. Subject nature goods services provided Company parties operations 51 <PAGE> made ready Year 2000 issues, impact Company's operations material contingency plans developed prior January 1, 2000.
