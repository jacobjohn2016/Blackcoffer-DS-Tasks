Eagle capacity 5 percent. Traffic fourth quarter challenging predict, impossible. As October 22, 2001, advanced booking levels points November points December, compared date periods year. These numbers increase however, current trends show higher normal number booked passengers showing flights. Yields decline steeply fourth quarter third, owing - deeper - fare sales weaker mix business traffic. AMR unit costs expected percent higher year - 11.8 cents - 20 percent cut capacity. This due large part numerous cost reduction initiatives Company put place response September 11 terrorist attacks - cutting capacity grounding aircraft, sharply reducing capital spending, closing facilities, trimming food service reducing workforce. In addition, Company expects lower fuel prices. Somewhat offsetting cost savings higher security costs, higher insurance premiums greater interest expense. Notwithstanding cost savings initiatives, Company short term reduce costs commensurate capacity (and revenue). As result, Company expects incur significant loss fourth quarter, full year 2001. SPECIAL RISK FACTOR Negative Impact Terrorist Attacks Among effects experienced Company September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks significant flight disruption costs caused FAA's imposed grounding U.S. airline industry's fleet, significantly increased security costs, significantly higher ticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, significantly reduced yields. Further terrorist attacks commercial aircraft flight result grounding Company's fleet, result significant reductions load factor yields, increased ticket refund, security costs. In addition, terrorist attacks involving commercial aircraft, general increase hostilities relating reprisals terrorist organizations otherwise, result decreased load factors yields airlines, including Company, result increased costs.
