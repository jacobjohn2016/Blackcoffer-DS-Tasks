Year 2000 system failures affect routine critical operations forecasting, purchasing, production, order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing collection. In addition, system failures affect Company's security, payroll operations, employee safety. The Company exposed potential risks parties Company interacts fail adequately address Year 2000 issues. SUNBEAM'S APPROACH 2000 ISSUES While Company's Year 2000 readiness planning underway year, quarter 1998 Company established cross-functional project team consisting senior managers, assisted external consulting firms retained provide consulting services assist Company implementing Year 2000 strategy. This team sponsored Company's Chief Financial Officer reports directly Company's Chief Executive Officer issue.

This inventory entered Company's Year 2000 database determination item's level criticality operations. For inventory items anticipated significant effect business corrected, Company's Year 2000 program envisions repair replacement testing items. All information relative item tracked Company's Year 2000 database. The Company completed phase fourth quarters 1998. The Company completed review readiness embedded microprocessors products determined Company's products Year 2000 date sensitive systems. PHASE 2 - CORRECTION TESTING: The phase Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program structured replace, upgrade remediate (as necessary) items identified Phase 1 requiring corrective action. Sunbeam relies functions perform tasks critical operations. Significant transactions impacted ready Year 2000 issues include, others, purchases materials, production management, order entry fulfillment, payroll processing billings collections. Systems applications identified Sunbeam Year 2000 ready critical Sunbeam's operations include financial software systems, process order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable functions, payroll applications, critical applications Company's manufacturing distribution facilities, warehouse management applications. Recognizing dependent entire company IT, Sunbeam decided 1997 replace primary business applications uniform international business accounting information system address systems applications listed improve internal reporting processes. Based representations manufacturer current - 37 - <PAGE> version uniform information system Year 2000 ready, Company upgraded business sites utilize uniform system Year 2000 ready version. In addition pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations utilized earlier non-Year 2000 ready version uniform business accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee, Health-o-Meter Sunbeam Latin America replaced non-Year 2000 ready systems uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe replaced key business components system. The Company actively replacing and/or upgrading number business systems Year 2000 ready, including localized business system packages candidates replaced uniform business accounting information system. For example, Coleman approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs lieu Sunbeam's uniform business accounting information system remediated tested Year 2000 ready. With respect Company's non-IT systems (for example, time attendance, security, in-line manufacturing hardware) Company analyzed items assess Year 2000 issues testing correcting times, necessary. PHASE 3 - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS BUSINESS PARTNERS: The phase Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program initiated fourth quarters 1998 designed assess interact Company's customers, suppliers, business partners. As part effort, Company surveyed 1,100 vendors suppliers, portion provide initial response. During half 1999, "high risk" vendors contacted directly number non-respondents decreased substantially. In fact, 7% Company's vendors surveyed categorized "high risk" includes non-respondents. Based recent responses survey continued evaluation, Company believes low medium risk Year 2000 issues remaining vendors. The Company continue monitor Year 2000 progress "high risk" vendors re-surveyed companies determine action. Furthermore, Company contacted alternate vendors Year 2000 ready replace critical vendors deemed "high risk" event vendors found Year 2000 ready. The Company process completing verification Year 2000 survey responses critical vendors Company. Sunbeam responded numerous customer inquiries Company's Year 2000 readiness. The Company verified Company's major customers planned programs deal Year 2000 issues completing process contacting major customers confirm implementing planned programs address Year 2000 issues. In order improve Company's communication customers, suppliers business partners, Company set Sunbeam Year 2000 telephone number providing Year 2000 information Company web site. PHASE 4 - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingency planning unresolved Year 2000 issues, issues arising party suppliers. The Company designed documented Year 2000 contingency plan process implementing it. The development contingency plan included process Company's critical non-IT systems evaluated Year 2000 readiness. As result evaluation, Company expect require additional operational equipment significant process contingency measures. Although Company significant risk party suppliers, contingency plan includes continuing evaluation readiness Company's suppliers minor increases Company's inventory requirements protect supply disruption. RISKS SUNBEAM'S 2000 APPROACH The independent consultants assisting Company Year 2000 readiness program reviewed concurred Company's approach, assisted developing cost estimates monitored costs largest single component (upgrade installation Company's uniform system) Company's Year 2000 program. Since Sunbeam's Year 2000 program developed monitored independent consultants, Company engage independent party verify program's approach total cost Company believes Company's exposure regard mitigated. In addition, external third-party diagnostic software packages designed analyze Year 2000 readiness business software programs, Company identify potential Year 2000 issues Coleman. Given this, Company believes mitigated risk validating verifying key program components. Management believes that, significant systems modified replaced, including uniform business accounting information system, Sunbeam's information systems environment made Year - 38 - <PAGE> 2000 ready prior January 1, 2000. Sunbeam's failure timely complete corrective work material adverse impact Company. With respect customers, suppliers business partners, failure parties Year 2000 ready material adverse impact Sunbeam. For example, failure Company's principal suppliers Year 2000 ready internal systems impact Company's ability manufacture and/or ship products maintain adequate inventory levels production. At time, Company believes "worst-case" scenario relating Year 2000 involves potential disruptions areas Company's operations rely parties, suppliers, systems work properly January 1, 2000. While system failures directly indirectly affect important operations Company subsidiaries significant manner, Company present estimate likelihood potential cost failures. Subject nature goods services provided Company parties operations made ready Year 2000 issues, potential impact Sunbeam's operations material. However, Company believes mitigated risks development implementation contingency plans discussed above. The nature focus Company's efforts address Year 2000 problem revised periodically interim goals achieved issues identified. In addition, important note description Company's efforts assessments necessarily involves estimates projections respect activities required future. These estimates projections subject change work continues, substantial.

A large majority costs expected incremental expenditures recur Year 2000 thereafter. Fees expenses related party consultants, involved PMO modification replacement software, represent approximately 75% total estimated cost. The balance total estimated cost relates primarily software license fees hardware, excludes costs Company employees. Sunbeam expects expenditures financed operating cash flows borrowings, applicable. A significant portion expenditures enhance Sunbeam's operating systems addition resolving Year 2000 issues. As Sunbeam completes assessment Year 2000 issues, actual expenditures incurred incurred differ materially amounts shown above. The bank credit facility permit Company spend $50 million Year 2000 testing remediation 1999.
