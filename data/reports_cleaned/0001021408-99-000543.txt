Substantially orders hand December 31, 1998, expected filled 1999. Steel Price Sensitivity Bethlehem's financial results significantly affected small (on percentage basis) variations realized prices products. For example, Bethlehem shipped 8.7 million net tons steel products recorded net sales $4.5 billion 1998, implying average realized price ton $516. A percent increase decrease implied average realized price 1998 would, pro forma basis, resulted increase decrease net sales pre-tax income $45 million. Competitive pressures steel industry severe. These pressures limit Bethlehem's ability obtain price increases lead decline prices, material adverse effect Bethlehem. Competition The domestic steel industry highly competitive. This competition affects prices Bethlehem charge products, utilization production facilities, ability sell higher products ultimately profitability. Capacity. There excess world capacity products produced Bethlehem. Moreover, foreign steel producers owned, controlled subsidized foreign governments. Decisions foreign producers continue marginal facilities influenced greater degree political economic policy considerations prevailing market conditions. In addition, overcapacity perpetuated continued operation, modernization upgrading marginal domestic facilities bankruptcy reorganization proceedings sale marginal domestic facilities owners, operate facilities lower cost structure. Over years, construction additional flat rolled production facilities result increased domestic capability 6 million tons 1998 levels. Electric Furnace Producers. Domestic integrated producers, Bethlehem, lost market share recent years domestic electric furnace producers. These companies efficient, low-cost producers make steel scrap electric furnaces (which expensive build integrated facilities), lower employment environmental costs ton shipped target regional markets. Through higher quality raw materials thin slab casting technology, electric furnace producers increasingly compete directly producers higher products, including cold rolled coated sheets. Imports. Domestic steel producers face significant competition foreign producers been, continue be, adversely affected unfairly traded imports. In cases, foreign producers pricing products production costs. Imports finished steel products accounted 26 percent domestic market 1998, 18 percent 1997 17 percent 1996.

The major restructuring domestic steel industry, began late 1970s early 1980s, removed steelmaking capacity existed meet market demand peak periods. During years, domestic producers met portion demand exceeded steelmaking capacity importing semifinished slabs rolling finished products mills. Substitute Materials. For steel products, substantial competition manufacturers products steel, including aluminum, ceramics, concrete, glass, plastic wood. Changes relative competitiveness substitute materials emergence additional substitute materials adversely affect future prices demand Bethlehem's products. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures $328 million 1998 (excluding acquisition Lukens Inc.) compared $228 million 1997 $259 million 1996. Capital expenditures 1999 estimated $450 million. During 1998, Bethlehem started construction Sparrows Point's continuous cold rolling mill complex. This $300 million complex, scheduled begin production early 2000, expected lower costs, improve quality enhance capabilities. About $256 million capital expenditures authorized 1998. At December 31, 1998, estimated cost completing authorized capital expenditures $640 million compared $750 million December 31, 1997. Bethlehem expects complete authorized capital expenditures 1999 2001. The domestic integrated steel industry capital intensive. As discussed "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES -- General" Report, Bethlehem's principal operations facilities varying ages, technologies operating efficiencies. Bethlehem continue make significant capital expenditures future maintain improve competitiveness operations facilities. Environment Bethlehem subject federal, state local environmental laws regulations concerning, things, air emissions, waste water discharges solid hazardous waste disposal. During years ended December 31, 1998, Bethlehem spent $136 million environmental control equipment. Expenditures environmental control equipment totaled $13 million 1998, $15 million 1997 $29 million 1996. The costs incurred 1998 operate maintain existing environmental control equipment $114 million (excluding interest costs including depreciation charges $14 million) compared $112 million 1997 $115 million 1996. In addition, Bethlehem required pay 4 <PAGE> fines penalties relating violations alleged violations laws regulations environmental control area. Bethlehem paid $910,000 1998, $830,000 1997 $160,000 1996 fines penalties. Under Clean Air Act, amended, coke-making facilities meet progressively stringent standards 25 years. Bethlehem operates coke-making facilities Burns Harbor, Indiana Lackawanna, New York. Operations Coke Division Bethlehem, Pennsylvania discontinued March, 1998. Bethlehem continue evaluate impact future emission control regulations Burns Harbor Lackawanna operations believes operations comply. Bethlehem federal state regulatory agencies conduct negotiations resolve differences interpretation environmental control requirements. In instances, negotiations held connection resolution pending environmental proceedings. Bethlehem believes significant curtailment interruptions important operations result proceedings negotiations. Bethlehem predict future specific environmental control requirements. Based existing anticipated regulations current legislation, Bethlehem estimates capital expenditures environmental control equipment average $10 million year years. However, estimates future capital expenditures operating costs required environmental compliance subject numerous uncertainties, including evolving nature regulations, imposition stringent requirements, availability technologies timing expenditures. Under Resource Conservation Recovery Act, amended ("RCRA"), owners facilities managed hazardous waste 1980 required investigate and, appropriate, remediate historic environmental contamination found facility. All Bethlehem's major facilities subject "Corrective Action Program", Bethlehem implemented implementing program facilities located Steelton, Pennsylvania; Lackawanna, New York; Burns Harbor, Indiana; Sparrows Point, Maryland. At Steelton, Bethlehem completed RCRA Facility Investigation ("RFI"), Corrective Measures Study ("CMS") remediation program approved United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") completed remediation 1994. At Lackawanna, Bethlehem conducting RFI expected completed year. At Burns Harbor, Bethlehem conducting RFI accordance EPA approved work plan require years complete. At Sparrows Point, Bethlehem, EPA Maryland Department Environment agreed phased RFI part comprehensive multimedia pollution prevention agreement entered U. S. District Court Maryland October 8, 1997. The potential costs remediation activities, any, Lackawanna, Burns Harbor Sparrows Point timeframe implementation activities estimated RFIs, possibly CMSs, completed approved. At plant Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem conducting remedial investigations pursuant Pennsylvania Land Recycling ("Brownfields") Program conjunction comprehensive redevelopment plans. These investigations performed input oversight Pennsylvania Department Environmental Protection EPA Region corrective action staff ensure actions acceptable state federal regulatory authorities. Bethlehem operations acquired part Lukens merger 1998 subject RCRA Corrective Action Program and, therefore, remediation facilities addressed ongoing business. Bethlehem residual liability remediation historic Lukens facilities sold shut merger, liabilities anticipated material. For example, electric arc furnace flue dust disposal site Coatesville, Pennsylvania, facility discussed Lukens 1997 Form 10-K continuing investigated Bethlehem remediation pursuant Pennsylvania Brownfields program. Bethlehem information time suggesting $3 million liability recognized Lukens site appropriate. 5 <PAGE> Under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act 1980, amended ("CERCLA", "Superfund"), EPA impose liability site remediation generators transporters waste, past present owners operators sites waste disposed of, fault legality disposal activities. Bethlehem actively involved 26 sites advised considered potentially responsible party CERCLA State Superfund legislation. Based experience site remediation knowledge extent involvement sites, Bethlehem expects share costs remediation sites material. In 1997 Form 10-K, Lukens discussed CERCLA sites involved. Subsequent discussion, Helen Kramer site settlement consummated Lukens paid settlement amount approximately $5.6 million merger Bethlehem Lukens. With regard Douglassville site, Lukens Bethlehem identified separate de- minimis potentially responsible parties signatories consent decree lodged with, entered by, U.S. District Court Eastern District Pennsylvania. Within 60 days entry consent decree, payment approximately $204,000 behalf Lukens $125,000 behalf Bethlehem made full resolution liabilities. Although Bethlehem's future quarterly annual results operations materially affected future costs environmental compliance, Bethlehem believes future costs environmental compliance material adverse effect consolidated financial position competitive position respect integrated domestic steelmakers subject environmental requirements. To extent competitors required undertake equivalent costs, Bethlehem's competitive position adversely affected. Purchased Materials Services Bethlehem purchases $3 billion year raw materials, energy, equipment, goods services commercial sources 40 countries. Bethlehem's profitability affected difficulties obtaining items prices paid them. These difficulties include things labor strikes, political instability natural disasters. Bethlehem made significant progress 1998 Strategic Sourcing initiatives expects progress 1999. See "ITEM 2.

Remaining remediation testing continue half 1999. Bethlehem continues evaluate readiness key suppliers customers. Starting April 1998, Bethlehem surveyed key suppliers, processors, warehousers electronic data interchange trading partners. To date, responses received 650 suppliers. Bethlehem follow-up letters suppliers compliance end 1998 (54 percent) confirm compliance. Additionally, Bethlehem received correspondence 500 key customers Year 2000 readiness continue review readiness quarters. During 1999, Bethlehem continue develop Year 2000 contingency plans areas business. Bethlehem's contingency plans address internal (staffing, computer systems inventory) external (suppliers, service providers, agents customers) risks. Bethlehem's strategies eliminating internal risk include development staffing plans Year 2000 roll-over, backup and/or alternate procedures inventory levels based anticipated customer supplier assessments. One Bethlehem's strategies reducing external risk develop alternate plans significant areas business vendor Year 2000 compliant. Bethlehem's target develop, half 1999, contingency plans critical business processes. The costs Bethlehem's Year 2000 Program continue planned levels. The total estimated incremental cost activity approximately $7 million. The cost continue charged normal operating expenses. Bethlehem expect incur extraordinary charges effort major information service projects deferred Year 2000 Program. Bethlehem believes taking reasonable steps ensure Year 2000 readiness. Bethlehem's ability meet projected goals depends, extent, Year 2000 readiness key suppliers customers, completion final remediation testing efforts successful development implementation contingency plans. These unanticipated Year 2000 issues material adverse effect Bethlehem's results operations financial condition. 7 <PAGE> Employment At end 1998, Bethlehem 17,000 employees, three-quarters covered agreements United Steelworkers America ("USWA").

Rebuilding Our Financial Strength We made progress 1998 improving financial condition, reducing unfunded pension obligation. Over past years, reduced pension liability $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion end 1993 $415 million end 1998. Additionally, net unrecognized gain reflected pension liability shown balance sheet. This unrecognized gain reflects, factors, investment performance performance assumed occur actuarial accounting assumptions. While accounting rules permit recognition investment gains, current market pension trust assets $6 billion essentially equal current pension obligation. Our liquidity totaled $480 million end year. This consisted $140 million cash $340 million borrowings revolving credit arrangement. During 1998, increased size revolving credit arrangement $75 million $600 million extended term June 2003. As capital structure, end year, debt percent invested capital 31%, 50% end 1992. In recognition progress made improving operating performance strengthening financial condition, Standard & Poor's Moody's Investor Services raised credit ratings early year level. Our objective achieve capital structure earn investment- grade credit rating. Profitable Growth During years, transformed Bethlehem eliminating underperforming operations, strengthening core businesses improving financial condition. As approach 21st century, positioned advantage future opportunities grow profitability. Our program profitable growth focuses areas. First, continue grow existing core steel businesses.

Third, acquire establish businesses related core steel businesses. Our recent joint venture Steel Construction Systems progress area. 6 <PAGE> Total Steel Imports millions tons [GRAPH GOES HERE] International Steel Trade The unprecedented level unfairly traded steel imports dumped United States continues injury Bethlehem American steel industry. The high levels imports adversely affected production, shipment levels prices, workforce schedules reduced operations. On January 7, 1999, Clinton Administration submitted "Comprehensive Plan Responding Increased Steel Imports" United States Congress. While Plan reviews helpful actions taken, falls short required sufficiently comprehensive, timely effective, significant increase imports, precipitous decline prices due dumping foreign steel financial losses American steel industry. Under circumstances, taking actions: . Legal -- We filed, continue file, legal actions. . Public Affairs -- We joined United Steelworkers America, leading steel companies concerned parties educational campaign called "Stand Up For Steel -- Stand Up America." . Governmental -- We continuing review Plan submitted Clinton Administration, continue work Administration Congress effort restore fair trade steel. We actions taking, Congress Administration, resolve issue threatens Company, stockholders, employees, customers communities operate. Business Outlook We U.S. economy continue moderate sustainable growth low inflation, growth slower compared past years. We domestic shipments 1999 100 million tons, slightly lower estimated 102 million tons shipped 1998. Competition intense 1999 due excess global steel capacity domestic supply. Additionally, continue concerned high levels unfairly traded steel imports, expect adversely affect 1999 results. While current business conditions remain difficult, continue Strategy concentrating steel rebuilding financial strength, actions reduce costs improve competitiveness. For Bethlehem, 1998 year contrast. Despite significant adverse effects unfair international steel trade, made important progress Vision Be Premier Steel Company. /s/ Hank Barnette Curtis H.

FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting Income Taxes, requires record valuation allowance "more portion deferred tax assets realized." It states, "forming conclusion valuation allowance needed difficult negative evidence cumulative losses recent years." The ultimate realization deferred tax asset depends ability generate sufficient taxable income future. Excluding estimated (losses) gains exiting businesses, Bethlehem reported net income consecutive years, undergone substantial restructuring made strategic capital expenditures years. Also, tax planning opportunities affect taxable income including selection depreciation methods timing contributions pension trust fund. We deferred tax asset realized future operating results tax planning opportunities. However, significant net operating loss carryforwards future tax deductions temporary differences make record valuation allowance. Accordingly, provided valuation allowance equal 50% total deferred tax asset related operating loss carryforward temporary differences exclusive postretirement benefits pensions. If tax loss year tax deduction postretirement benefits pensions exceeds financial statement expense, tax law 20-year carryforward loss future taxable income. We, therefore, sufficient time realize future tax benefits.
