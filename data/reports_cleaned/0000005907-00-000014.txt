LEGISLATIVE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS Telecommunications Act 1996 In February 1996, Telecommunications Act law. The Telecommunications Act, things, designed foster local exchange competition establishing regulatory framework govern competitive entry local long distance telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Act permit Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) provide interexchange services originating state region demonstrating FCC provision public interest satisfying conditions developing local competition established Telecommunications Act. In August 1996, FCC adopted rules regulations, including pricing rules (the "Pricing Rules") implement local competition provisions Telecommunications Act, including respect terms conditions interconnection LEC networks standards governing purchase unbundled network elements wholesale services LECs. These implementing rules rely state public utilities commissions (PUCs) develop specific rates procedures applicable states framework prescribed FCC. On July 18, 1997, United States Court Appeals 8th Circuit issued decision holding FCC lacks authority establish pricing rules implement sections local competition provisions Telecommunications Act applicable interconnection LEC networks purchase unbundled network elements wholesale services LECs. Accordingly, Court vacated rules FCC adopted August 1996, stayed Court September 1996. On October 14, 1997, 8th Circuit Court Appeals vacated FCC Rule prohibited incumbent LECs separating network elements combined LEC's network, request competitor purchasing elements. This decision increased difficulty costs providing competitive local service unbundled network elements purchased incumbent LECs. On January 25, 1999, Unites States Supreme Court issued decision reversing 8th Circuit Court Appeal's holding FCC lacks jurisdiction establish pricing rules applicable interconnection purchase unbundled network elements, Court Appeal's decision vacate FCC's rule prohibiting incumbent LECs separating network elements combined LEC's network. The effect Supreme Court's decision reinstate FCC's rules governing pricing separation unbundled network elements. The 8th Circuit Court Appeals <PAGE> incumbent LECs' claims FCC jurisdiction adopt pricing rule, rules adopted consistent applicable provisions Act. The Supreme Court vacated FCC's rule identifying defining unbundled network elements incumbent LECs required make entrants, directed FCC reexamine issue light standards mandated Act. In response Supreme Court's decision, FCC completed re-examination released order identifying defining unbundled network elements incumbent LECs required make entrants. That order re-adopted original list elements, exceptions. An association incumbent LECs appealed FCC's order United States Court Appeals District Columbia Circuit, asked Court hear appeal expedited basis. A number parties, including AT&T incumbent LECs, petitioned FCC reconsider and/or clarify order. The FCC moved hold appeal abeyance pending disposition reconsideration petitions. In view proceedings pending 8th Circuit, DC Circuit, FCC state PUCs, assurance prices conditions established state provide effective local service entry competition provide AT&T market opportunities. In December 1999, Bell Atlantic obtained approval offer long distance telecommunications service New York state, time RBOC received approval Telecommunications Act. Bell Atlantic began offering combined local long distance service January 2000. In January 2000, SBC Communications, Inc. filed FCC application authorization offer long distance telecommunications service Texas. Under Telecommunications Act, FCC required issue decision application April 2000. Modification Final Judgment 1982 Prior 1996, AT&T RBOCs subject provisions Modification Final Judgment 1982 (MFJ) implementation. The Telecommunications Act effectively superseded future operation MFJ. Consequently, April 11, 1996, Judge Harold Greene issued order terminating MFJ. Regulation Rates AT&T subject jurisdiction FCC respect interstate international rates, lines services, matters. From July 1989 October 1995, FCC regulated AT&T system "price caps" AT&T's prices, earnings, limited. On October 12, 1995, recognizing decade enormous change long distance market finding AT&T lacked market power interstate long distance market, FCC reclassified AT&T "non-dominant" carrier domestic interstate services. As result, AT&T subject regulations long distance competitors services. Thus, AT&T longer subject price cap regulation services, file tariffs presumed lawful day's notice, free regulations reporting requirements apply dominant carriers. In addition, October 31, 1996, FCC issued order prohibited non-dominant carriers, including AT&T, filing tariffs <PAGE> domestic interstate services. AT&T parties filed appeal FCC's order United States Court Appeals D.C. Circuit. In February 1997, D.C. Circuit stayed effectiveness FCC's order pending appeal. Oral argument scheduled. If Court affirms FCC's order lifts stay, non-dominant carriers, including AT&T, utilize mechanisms tariffs establish terms conditions apply domestic, interstate telecommunications services. Furthermore, May 1997, FCC adopted orders relating Price Caps, Access Reform, Universal Service substantially revised level structure access charges AT&T long distance carrier pays incumbent LECs. AT&T agreed pass consumers savings AT&T result access charge reform. AT&T began implementing reductions July 15, 1997. Consequently, AT&T's results June 1997 reflects lower revenue minute usage lower access interconnection costs minute usage. The Price Cap Order requires LECs reduce price cap indices 6.5 percent annually, adjustment inflation, result reduction interstate access charges long distance carriers, AT&T, pay LECs. The Access Charge Reform Order restructured access charges costs vary usage recovered flat-rate basis permitted increased flat-rate assessments multiline business customers residential lines primary telephone line. This restructuring reduction access charges assessed long distance carriers usage basis. Finally, Universal Service Order (which represents FCC mandated contribution support schools libraries rural health care programs, high cost support low income support mechanisms paid Universal Service Administrative Company) adopts mechanism funding universal service expands set carriers contribute support universal service long distance carriers carriers, including LECs, provide interstate telecommunications services. Similarly, set carriers eligible universal service support expanded LECs eligible carrier providing local service customer, including AT&T entrant local markets. The Universal Service Order adopted measures provide discounts telecommunications services, Internet access inside wire eligible schools libraries rural health carrier providers. AT&T remains subject statutory requirements Title Communications Act. AT&T offer service rates, terms conditions just, reasonable unreasonably discriminatory; subject FCC's complaint process, give notice FCC affected customers prior discontinuance, reduction, impairment service. AT&T made commitments address concerns raised regard potential impact declaring AT&T non-dominant, including three-year rate assurance low income low usage residential users three-year limit on, 5 days advance notice for, rate increases 800 directory assistance analog private line services. AT&T's international private line services classified non-dominant years. AT&T's switched international services subject increased competition, similar domestic services May 9, 1996, FCC adopted order reclassifying AT&T non-dominant carrier services. AT&T made voluntary commitments address issues raised proceeding, including commitments: (i) maintain annual average revenue minute international residential calls <PAGE> 1995 level May 9, 1999, event significant change substantially raises AT&T's costs, provide FCC business days notice prior implementing rate increases raise annual average revenue minute calls 1995 level; (ii) maintain discount calling plans providing 15% discount basic pricing schedules May 9, 1999. AT&T made voluntary commitments relating operation international cable facilities, negotiation settlement agreements foreign carriers relationship foreign partners. In addition matters respect Telecommunications Act, state public service commissions similar authorities regulatory power intrastate rates, lines services matters regulate AT&T's local intrastate communications services. The system regulation states rate-of-return regulation. In recent years, states adopted systems regulation, as: complete removal rate-of-return regulation, pricing flexibility rules, price caps incentive regulation. Wireless Regulatory Environment The FCC regulates licensing, construction, operation, acquisition, sale resale wireless systems United States pursuant Communications Act 1934 rules, regulations policies promulgated FCC. Licensing wireless services systems The AT&T Wireless Group owns protected geographic service area licenses granted FCC provide cellular service PCS. It owns licenses granted FCC provide point-to-multi-point communications services bands, including significant licenses 37 39 gigahertz bands. A cellular system operates 25 megahertz frequency blocks FCC allocates cellular radio service. Cellular systems generally two-way mobile voice applications, data applications fixed wireless services well. Cellular license areas issued metropolitan service areas rural service areas. Initially, cellular licenses metropolitan service area rural service area awarded local exchange telephone company FCC, license awarded competitive processes lotteries. Licenses issued beginning 1983, years numerous license transfers corporate reorganizations obscured original pattern distributing set licenses local telephone company affiliates companies local exchange service license area. A PCS system operates frequency blocks allocated personal communications services. PCS systems generally two-way voice applications carry two-way data communications well. Narrowband PCS systems, contrast, non-voice applications paging data service separately licensed. For purpose awarding PCS licenses, FCC segmented United States 51 large regions called major trading areas, comprised 493 smaller regions called basic trading areas. The FCC awarded PCS licenses major trading area licenses basic trading area. Thus, generally, licensees authorized compete area. The major trading area <PAGE> licenses authorize 30 megahertz spectrum. One basic trading area licenses 30 megahertz spectrum, 10 megahertz each. The FCC permits licensees split licenses assign portion, geographic frequency basis both, party. The FCC awarded initial PCS licenses auction. Auctions began 30 megahertz major trading area licenses concluded 1998 basic trading area licenses. However, March 1998, FCC adopted order troubled entities won PCS 30 megahertz C-Block licenses auction obtain financial relief payment obligations return C-Block licenses FCC reauctioning. The FCC completed reauction returned licenses April 1999. In addition, C-block licenses bankruptcy proceedings, licenses returned FCC reauction. Under FCC's current rules spectrum aggregation limits affecting wireless licensees, entity hold attributable interests, generally 20% equity of, officer director position with, licensee, licenses 45 megahertz PCS, cellular specialized mobile radio services significant overlap geographic area. Significant overlap occur 10% population PCS licensed service area cellular and/or specialized mobile radio service area(s). The FCC recently increased limit 55 megahertz situations 25 megahertz cellular rural service area attributed 30 megahertz PCS license. These spectrum aggregation rules subject pending FCC proceeding revise eliminate them. All wireless licenses 10-year term, end term renewed. The FCC award renewal expectancy wireless licensee provided substantial service past license term, substantially complied applicable FCC rules policies Communications Act. Licenses revoked license renewal applications denied FCC determines renewal serve public interest. FCC rules provide competing renewal applications licenses considered comparative hearings, establish qualifications competing applications standards applied hearings. All wireless licenses satisfy coverage requirements. Cellular licenses required, years grant license, construct systems provide service (at signal strength) territory encompassed service area. Failure provide coverage resulted reduction relevant license area FCC. All A B block PCS licensees construct facilities offer coverage one-third population service area years original license grants two-thirds population ten years. All D E block PCS licensees construct facilities offer coverage one-fourth population licensed area "make showing substantial service license area" years original license grants. Licensees fail meet coverage requirements subject forfeiture license. For period years grant PCS license, subject extension, licensee required share spectrum existing licensees operate fixed microwave systems license area circumstances interconnection <PAGE> local exchange carrier competitive local exchange carrier. In effort balance competing interests existing microwave users newly authorized PCS licensees, FCC adopted transition plan relocate microwave operators spectrum blocks cost sharing plan relocation incumbent benefits PCS licensee, licensees share cost relocation. Initially, transition plan allowed microwave users operate PCS spectrum voluntary two-year negotiation period additional mandatory one-year negotiation period. For public safety entities dedicate majority system communications police, fire emergency medical services operations, voluntary negotiation period years, additional mandatory two-year negotiation period. In 1998, FCC shortened voluntary negotiation period year, lengthening mandatory negotiation period, non-public safety PCS licensees C, D, E F Blocks. Parties unable reach agreement time periods refer matter FCC resolution, incumbent microwave user permitted continue operations final FCC resolution matter. The transition cost sharing plans expire April 4, 2005, time remaining microwave incumbents PCS spectrum responsible costs relocating alternate spectrum locations. Wireless systems subject FAA regulations governing location, lighting construction transmitter towers antennas subject regulation federal environmental laws FCC's environmental regulations. State local zoning land regulations apply tower siting construction activities. We expect common carrier point-to-point microwave facilities connect wireless cell sites, link main switching office. The FCC licenses facilities separately subject regulation technical parameters service. The Communications Act preempts state local regulation entry of, rates charged by, provider private mobile radio service commercial mobile radio service, includes PCS cellular service. The FCC regulate commercial mobile radio service private mobile radio service rates. However, commercial mobile radio service providers common carriers required Communications Act offer services public unreasonable discrimination. The FCC's rules require providers permit resell services profit; however, rules expire 2002. Transfers assignments cellular PCS licenses The Communications Act FCC rules require FCC's prior approval assignment transfer control license PCS cellular system. In addition, FCC established transfer disclosure requirements require licensees assign transfer control PCS license years license terms file sale contracts, option agreements, management agreements documents disclosing total consideration licensee receive return transfer assignment license. Non-controlling interests entity holds FCC license generally bought sold FCC approval subject FCC's spectrum aggregation limits. However, notification expiration earlier termination applicable waiting period Section 7A Clayton Act Federal Trade Commission Department Justice required, approval state local regulatory authorities <PAGE> competent jurisdiction, sell acquire PCS cellular interests size. Foreign ownership Under existing law, 20% FCC licensee's capital stock owned, directly indirectly, voted non-U.S. citizens representatives, foreign government representatives foreign corporation. If FCC licensee controlled entity, case ownership structure, 25% entity's capital stock owned voted non-U.S. citizens representatives, foreign government representatives foreign corporation. Foreign ownership 25% level allowed FCC find higher levels inconsistent public interest. The FCC ruled higher levels foreign ownership, 100%, presumptively consistent public interest respect investors nations. If foreign ownership exceed permitted level, FCC revoke FCC licenses, seek declaratory ruling FCC allowing foreign ownership actions reduce foreign ownership percentage order avoid loss licenses. We knowledge present foreign ownership violation restrictions. Recent regulatory developments The FCC announced rules making emergency 911 services cellular, PCS commercial mobile radio service providers, including enhanced 911 services provide caller's telephone number, location information. The original timetable required commercial mobile radio services providers process transmit 911 calls call validation, including callers speech hearing disabilities, late 1997. Additionally, commercial mobile radio service providers required actions enabling relay caller's automatic number identification cell site requested public safety dispatch agency agreed reimburse provider additional expenses incurred provide services. In October 1999, FCC revised rules eliminate requirement agencies reimburse wireless providers. In companion order issued earlier fall 1999, FCC modified rules requiring commercial mobile radio service providers provide information location 911 call. The modified rules providers network handset-based technologies provide information. However, providers permitted recover costs deploying technologies dispatch agencies. The FCC granted waivers requirement provide 911 service users speech hearing disabilities providers, obtained waiver. On June 9, 1999, FCC adopted rules designed ensure analog cellular calls 911 completed. These rules, apply digital cellular service PCS, give cellular provider choice ways meet requirement. State actions incompatible FCC rules subject preemption. On August 8, 1996, FCC released order implementing interconnection provisions Telecommunications Act. Although provisions order struck U.S. Court Appeals Eighth Circuit, January 25, 1999, U.S. Supreme Court reversed Eighth Circuit upheld FCC respects material operations. On June 10, 1999, Eighth Circuit issued order requesting briefs issues <PAGE> address earlier order, including pricing regime interconnection. While appeals pending, rationale FCC's order adopted states' public utility commissions, result charges cellular PCS operators pay interconnect traffic public switched telephone network declined significantly pre-1996 levels. In implementation Telecommunications Act, FCC established federal universal service requirements affect commercial mobile radio service operators. Under FCC's rules, commercial mobile radio service providers potentially eligible receive universal service subsidies time; however, required contribute federal universal service fund required contribute state universal funds. Many states moving forward develop state universal service fund programs. A number state funds require contributions, varying greatly state state, commercial mobile radio service providers. The FCC's universal service order modified appeal U.S. Court Appeals Fifth Circuit. The court's ruling effect reducing commercial mobile radio service provider support payments required federal universal service programs. On August 1, 1996, FCC released report order expanding flexibility cellular, PCS commercial mobile radio service providers provide fixed mobile services. These fixed services include, limited to, wireless local loop services, example, apartment office buildings, wireless backup services private branch exchange switchboards local area networks, event interruptions due weather emergencies. The FCC decided fixed services provided co-primary basis mobility services subjected universal service obligations, fixed services regulated, proposed presumption regulated commercial mobile radio service services. If fixed services provided ancillary service carrier's mobility services, FCC decided fixed services regulated commercial mobile radio services. The FCC adopted rules telephone number portability enable customers migrate landline cellular telephone numbers cellular PCS providers cellular PCS provider service provider. On February 8, 1999, FCC extended deadline compliance requirement November 24, 2002, subject determination number portability conserve telephone numbers. The FCC adopted rules requiring cellular PCS providers provide functions facilitate electronic surveillance law enforcement officials June 30, 2000, proposed adopt additional obligations furthering provision functions. Representatives cellular PCS industry challenging surveillance rules. Additionally, clear commercial mobile radio service providers comply rules' compatibility requirements current deadline June 30, 2000; clear FCC grant waivers extend deadline scope penalties failing comply be. The FCC determined interstate, interexchange offerings, commonly referred long distance, commercial mobile radio service providers subject interstate, interexchange rate averaging integration provisions Communications Act. Rate averaging requires average interstate long distance commercial mobile radio service rates high cost urban areas. The FCC delayed implementation <PAGE> rate integration requirements respect wide area rate plans offer pending reconsideration rules. The FCC delayed requirement integrate commercial mobile radio service long distance rates commercial mobile radio service affiliates. On December 31, 1998, FCC reaffirmed, reconsideration, interexchange rate integration rules apply interexchange commercial mobile radio service services. The FCC announced initiate proceeding determine integration requirements apply typical commercial mobile radio service offerings, including one-rate plans. Until proceeding concluded, FCC enforce long distance rate integration services separately state long distance toll charge bill customers. To extent AT&T Wireless Group offers services subject FCC's rate integration averaging requirements, requirements generally reduce pricing flexibility. We assure FCC decline impose rate integration averaging requirements AT&T Wireless Group decline require integrate commercial mobile radio service long distance rates commercial mobile radio service affiliates. The FCC recently adopted rules limiting customer proprietary network information telecommunications carriers marketing broad range telecommunications services customers customers affiliated companies. The rules struck federal circuit court 1999, effectiveness stayed pending court's review petition FCC reconsideration. Even rules reinstated, AT&T Wireless Group anticipate result significant adverse impact financial position, results operation liquidity. In addition, state commissions increasingly aggressive efforts conserve numbering resources. These efforts impact wireless service providers disproportionately imposing additional costs limiting access numbering resources. Examples state conservation methods include: number pooling, number rationing code sharing. A number states petitioned FCC authority adopt "technology specific" overlays require wireless providers obtain telephone numbers separate area code require wireless providers change customers' telephone numbers. The FCC approval states' subsequent implementation "technology specific overlays" increase wireless providers' cost business impact ability market services. On June 2, 1999, FCC released notice proposed rulemaking soliciting comments variety administrative technical measures promote efficient allocation numbering resources. Adoption proposed methods disproportionate impact commercial mobile radio services providers. The FCC adopting rules govern customer billing commercial mobile radio services providers applied number rules commercial mobile radio service providers. The FCC adopted detailed billing rules landline telecommunications service providers extend remaining rules commercial mobile radio services providers. The FCC require billing detail provided consumers, add expense billing process systems modified conform requirements. The FCC carriers decide pass mandatory universal service contributions customers required provide full explanation program, ensure carriers pass contribution recover amounts greater mandatory <PAGE> contributions customers. Adoption FCC's proposals increase complexity billing processes restrict ability bill customers services commercially advantageous way. The FCC adopted order determines obligations telecommunications carriers make services accessible individuals disabilities. The order requires telecommunications services providers offer equipment services accessible useable persons disabilities. While rules exempt telecommunications carriers meeting general disability access requirements results readily achievable, clear liberally FCC construe exemption. Accordingly, rules require make material network, product line, services expense. In June 1999, FCC initiated administrative rulemaking proceeding facilitate offering calling party pays optional wireless service. Under calling party pays service, party placing call wireless customer pays wireless airtime charges. Most wireless customers United States pay place calls receive them. Adoption calling party pays system widespread basis make commercial mobile radio service providers competitive traditional landline telecommunications providers provision regular telephone service. State regulation local approvals State local governments preempted regulating market entry by, rates of, wireless operators. However, state governments regulate terms conditions wireless service states imposed (or proposed legislation impose) consumer protection regulations wireless industry. States impose universal service support regimes wireless telecommunications carriers, similar requirements established FCC. At local level, wireless facilities typically subject zoning land regulation. State local jurisdictions impose conditions driver's wireless technology operating motor vehicle. However, federal Telecommunications Act, local state governments categorically prohibit construction wireless facilities community. Cable Regulation Legislation The operation cable television systems extensively regulated FCC, state governments local governments. The Telecommunications Act removes barriers competition cable television market local telephone market reduces scope cable rate regulation. The Telecommunications Act required FCC implement numerous rulemakings, final outcome determined due court challenges. Moreover, Congress FCC frequently revisited subject cable television regulation again. Future legislative regulatory adversely affect AT&T Broadband's operations. This section briefly summarizes key laws regulations affecting growth operation AT&T Broadband's cable systems. Cable Rate Regulation. The 1992 Cable Act imposed extensive rate regulation regime cable television industry, limited ability <PAGE> cable companies increase subscriber fees. Under regime, cable systems subjected rate regulation, faced "effective competition" local franchise area. Federal law defines "effective competition" community-specific basis requiring satisfaction conditions rarely satisfied current marketplace. Although FCC establishes cable rate rules, local government units (commonly referred local franchising authorities LFAs) primarily responsible administering regulation lowest level cable -- basic service tier (BST), typically local broadcast stations access channels. Before LFA begins BST rate regulation, certify FCC follow applicable federal rules, LFAs voluntarily declined exercise authority. LFAs primary responsibility regulating cable equipment rates. Under federal law, charges types cable equipment unbundled monthly charges programming services, priced higher operator's actual cost, 11.25% rate return. The FCC historically administered rate regulation cable programming service tiers (CPST), typically satellite-delivered programming. Under Telecommunications Act, FCC's ability regulate CPST rates expired March 31, 1999. The FCC position adjudicate pending CPST complaints strictly limit review refund orders time period predating March 31, 1999. Cable Entry Into Telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act state local laws regulations prohibit effect prohibiting entity providing interstate intrastate telecommunications service. States authorized, however, impose "competitively neutral" requirements universal service, public safety welfare, service quality, consumer protection. State local governments retain authority manage public rights-of-way. Although Telecommunications Act clarifies traditional cable franchise fees based revenues related provision cable television services, LFAs require reasonable, competitively neutral compensation management public rights-of-way cable operators provide telecommunications service. In 1999, conflicting inconclusive federal court decisions addressed issues lawful "management right-of-ways" "competitively neutral compensation." The Telecommunications Act prohibits LFAs requiring cable operators provide telecommunications service facilities condition franchise grant, renewal transfer, LFAs argue seek "institutional networks" part franchise negotiations. The favorable pole attachment rates afforded cable operators federal law increased utility companies owning poles year phase-in period beginning 2001, cable operator telecommunications service, cable service, plant. The FCC clarified cable operator's provision Internet service affect favorable pole rates. Cable entry telecommunications affected regulatory landscape fashioned FCC state regulators. One critical component Telecommunications Act intended facilitate entry telecommunications providers (including cable operators) interconnection obligation imposed telecommunications carriers. This requires, example, incumbent local telephone company competing telecommunications providers connect local telephone distribution <PAGE> system. In January 1999 decision, United States Supreme Court upheld FCC's fundamental interconnection requirements. Cable Systems Providing Internet Service. Although present significant federal regulation cable system delivery Internet services, FCC recently issued reports finding impose regulation, situation change cable systems expand broadband delivery Internet services. In particular, proposals advanced FCC Congress require cable operators provide access unaffiliated Internet service providers online service providers. Additionally, local franchising authorities imposition mandatory Internet access requirements part cable franchise renewals transfers. A federal district court Portland, Oregon recently upheld legal ability local franchising authorities impose conditions, appeal filed Ninth Circuit Court Appeals, oral argument held parties awaiting decision. Other local authorities imposed impose mandatory Internet access requirements cable operators. Finally, states legislation require mandatory access unafffiliated Internet service providers. These developments could, widespread, burden capacity cable systems complicate delay plans providing Internet service. Telephone Company Entry Into Cable Television. The Telecommunications Act telephone companies compete directly cable operators repealing historic telephone company/cable company cross-ownership ban FCC's video dialtone regulations. This LECs, including RBOCs, compete cable operators inside telephone service areas. Because resources, LECs formidable competitors, LECs begun offering cable service. Under Telecommunications Act, LEC entity providing video programming customers regulated traditional cable operator (subject local franchising federal regulatory requirements), elects provide programming "open video system" (OVS). It anticipated primary benefit OVS regulatory model avoid obtain local franchise prior providing services. However, January 1999 federal court appeals decision held OVS providers required obtain franchise. To eligible OVS status, provider occupy one-third system's activated channels demand channels exceeds supply. Nor discriminate programmers establish unreasonable rates, terms conditions service. Although LECs cable operators expand offerings traditional service boundaries, general prohibitions remain LEC buyouts (i.e., ownership interest exceeding 10 percent) co-located cable systems, cable operator buyouts co-located LEC systems, joint ventures cable operators LECs market. The Telecommunications Act limited exceptions buyout prohibition. Electric Utility Entry Into Telecommunications/Cable Television. The Telecommunications Act registered utility holding companies subsidiaries provide telecommunications services, information services, services products subject jurisdiction FCC, notwithstanding Public Utilities Holding Company Act. Electric utilities establish separate subsidiaries, "exempt telecommunications companies" apply FCC operating authority. Again, resources, electric utilities formidable competitors. <PAGE> Cable Television Ownership Restrictions. Pursuant 1992 Cable Act, FCC adopted regulations establishing 30% limit number homes nationwide cable operator reach cable systems holds attributable interest increase 35% additional cable systems minority controlled. The FCC stayed effectiveness ownership limits pending appeal September 16, 1993 decision United States District Court District Columbia which, things, found unconstitutional provision 1992 Cable Act requiring FCC establish ownership limits. If ownership limits determined appeal constitutional, affect AT&T Broadband's ability acquire attributable interests additional cable systems including pending MediaOne Merger. The FCC recently completed reconsideration national subscriber cap formula manner cable ownership attributed. Although FCC formula increased number subscribers AT&T Broadband "own", clear attribution rules pending MediaOne Merger considered compliant ownership cap. The FCC previously adopted regulations limiting carriage cable operator national programming services operator holds attributable interest 40% activated channels cable operator's systems. The rules provide additional channels 45% limit, whichever greater, provided additional channels carry minority controlled programming services. The regulations grandfather existing carriage arrangements exceed channel limits, require channel capacity devoted unaffiliated programming services system achieves compliance regulations. These channel occupancy limits apply 75 activated channels cable system, rules apply local regional programming services. The Telecommunications Act eliminates statutory restrictions broadcast/cable cross-ownership (including broadcast network/cable restrictions), leaves place existing FCC regulations prohibiting local cross-ownership television stations cable systems. The Telecommunications Act leaves place existing restrictions cable cross-ownership Satellite Master Antenna Television (SMATV) multi-channel multi-point distribution systems (MMDS) facilities, lifts restrictions cable operator subject effective competition. In January 1995, however, FCC adopted regulations permit cable operators operate SMATV systems franchise area, provided operation consistent local cable franchise requirements. Must Carry/Retransmission Consent. The 1992 Cable Act broadcast signal carriage requirements local commercial television broadcast stations elect years requiring cable system carry station ("must carry") negotiating payments granting permission cable operator carry station ("retransmission consent"). Less popular stations typically elect carry, popular stations typically elect retransmission consent. Must carry requests dilute appeal cable system's programming offerings, retransmission consent demands require substantial payments concessions (e.g. requirement cable system carry local broadcaster's affiliated cable programming service). Either option potentially adverse effect AT&T Broadband's business. The burden must-carry obligations dramatically increase television broadcast stations proceed planned conversions digital transmissions FCC determines pending rulemaking cable systems carry analog digital signals transmitted television stations. <PAGE> Access Channels. LFAs include franchise provisions requiring cable operators set channels access programming. Federal law requires cable system 36 channels designate portion activated channel capacity (either 10% 15%) commercial leased access unaffiliated parties. The FCC adopted rules regulating terms, conditions maximum rates cable operator charge designated channel capacity, commercial leased access channels limited. In February 1997, FCC released revised rules mandated modest rate reduction made commercial leased access attractive option party programmers, part-time leased access carriage. "Anti-Buy Through" Provisions. Federal law requires cable system permit customers purchase premium pay-per-view video programming offered operator per-channel per-program basis necessity subscribing tier service (other basic service tier) system's lack addressable converter boxes technological limitations permit so. The statutory exemption cable systems technological capability comply expires October 2002, FCC extend period deemed necessary. Access Programming. To spur development independent cable programmers competition incumbent cable operators, 1992 Cable Act imposed restrictions dealings cable operators cable programmers. Of special significance competitive business posture, 1992 Cable Act precludes satellite video programmers affiliated cable operators favoring cable operators competing multichannel video programming distributors (such DBS MMDS distributors). This provision limits ability vertically integrated satellite cable programmers offer exclusive programming arrangements AT&T Broadband. Both Congress FCC considered proposals expand program access rights cable's competitors, including possibility subjecting terrestrially delivered video programming video programmers affiliated cable operators program access requirements. Inside Wiring; Subscriber Access. In order issued 1997, FCC established rules require incumbent cable operator expiration termination MDU service contract sell, abandon, remove "home run" wiring installed cable operator MDU building. These inside wiring rules expected assist building owners attempts replace existing cable operators programming providers pay building owner higher fee, fee permissible. The FCC proposed abrogating exclusive MDU contracts held incumbent cable operators, allowing contracts held entrants. In proceeding, FCC preempted restrictions deployment private antenna rental property exclusive tenant, balconies patios. This FCC ruling limit extent multiple dwelling unit owners enforce aspects MDU argreements prohibit, example, placement digital broadcast satellite receiver antennae MDU areas exclusive occupancy renter. These developments make difficult AT&T Broadband provide service MDUs. Other FCC Regulations. In addition FCC regulations noted above, FCC regulations covering areas equal employment opportunity, customer privacy, programming practices (including, things, syndicated program exclusivity, network program nonduplication, local <PAGE> sports blackouts, indecent programming, lottery programming, political programming, sponsorship identification, children's programming advertisements closed captioning), registration cable systems facilities licensing, maintenance records public inspection files, frequency usage, lockbox availability, antenna structure notification, tower marking lighting, consumer protection customer service standards, technical standards, consumer electronics equipment compatibility emergency alert systems. The FCC recently ruled cable customers allowed purchase cable converters parties established multi-year phase-in security functions, remain operator's exclusive control, unbundled basic converter functions, satisfied party vendors. The FCC authority enforce regulations imposition substantial fines, issuance cease desist orders and/or imposition administrative sanctions, revocation FCC licenses needed operate transmission facilities connection cable operations. Copyright. Cable television systems subject federal copyright licensing covering carriage television radio broadcast signals. In exchange filing reports contributing percentage revenue federal copyright royalty pool (such percentage varies depending size system number distant broadcast television signals carried), cable operators obtain blanket permission retransmit copyrighted material broadcast signals. The modification elimination compulsory copyright license subject continuing review adversely affect AT&T Broadband's ability obtain desired broadcast programming. In addition, cable industry pays music licensing fees Broadcast Music, Inc. negotiating similar arrangement American Society Composers, Authors Publishers. Copyright clearances nonbroadcast programming services arranged private negotiations. State Local Regulation. Cable television systems generally operated pursuant nonexclusive franchises granted municipality state local government entity. The Telecommunications Act clarified entity providing cable services obtain local franchise depends solely entity crosses public rights way. Federal law prohibits franchise authorities granting exclusive franchises unreasonably refusing award additional franchises covering existing cable system's service area. Cable franchises generally granted fixed terms cases terminable franchisee fails comply material provisions. Non-compliance cable operator franchise provisions result monetary penalties. The terms conditions franchises vary materially jurisdiction jurisdiction. Each franchise generally provisions governing cable operations, service rates, franchise fees, system construction maintenance obligations, system channel capacity, design technical performance, customer service standards, indemnification protections. A number states subject cable television systems jurisdiction centralized state governmental agencies. Although LFAs considerable discretion establishing franchise terms, federal limitations. For example, LFAs insist franchise fees exceeding 5% <PAGE> system's gross revenue, dictate technology system, video programming identifying broad categories programming. Federal law renewal procedures designed protect incumbent franchisees arbitrary denials renewal. Even franchise renewed, franchise authority seek impose onerous requirements significant upgrades facilities services increased franchise fees funding channels condition renewal. Similarly, franchise authority's consent required purchase sale cable system franchise, authority attempt impose burdensome onerous franchise requirements connection request consent. Historically, franchises renewed cable operators provided satisfactory services complied terms franchises. Proposed Changes Regulation. The regulation cable television systems federal, state local levels subject political process constant flux past decade. Material law regulatory requirements anticipated assurance AT&T Broadband's business affected adversely future legislation, regulation deregulation. COMPETITION Competition communications services based price pricing plans, types services offered, customer service, access customer premises, communications quality, reliability availability, as, business customers, ability provide high quality data communication services technical support. AT&T's principal competitors include MCIWorldcom, Inc., Sprint Corporation, RBOCs GTE Corporation. AT&T experiences significant competition long distance dial resellers. The ILECs substantial capital resources, long standing customer relationships extensive existing facilities network rights-of-way AT&T's primary competitors local services market. In addition, anticipated number long distance telecommunication, wireless cable service providers enter local services market competition AT&T. Some potential competitors substantial financial resources. AT&T compete local services market number CLECs, existing local networks significant financial resources. Competition subscribers wireless service providers based principally services features offered, call quality, customer service, system coverage price. The AT&T Wireless Group's ability compete successfully depend, part, ability anticipate respond competitive factors affecting industry, including services introduced, consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions pricing strategies. The AT&T Wireless Group's primary competitors Vodafone AirTouch, BellSouth, Bell Atlantic, GTE, Nextel Communications, Inc., SBC, VoiceStream Communications Sprint. In addition, wireless communications industry experiencing significant consolidation AT&T Wireless Group expects consolidation continue. The previously announced mergers joint ventures Bell Atlantic/GTE/Vodafone/AirTouch, MCIWorldCom/Sprint SBC/Ameritech <PAGE> create large, well-capitalized competitors substantial financial, technical, marketing resources respond AT&T Wireless Group's offerings. Assuming mergers ventures completed today, AT&T Wireless Group estimates ranking decline U.S. revenue, U.S. subscriber share fourth terms U.S. population covered licenses, POPs. As result, competitors offer nationwide services plans quickly economically AT&T Wireless Group obtain roaming rates favorable obtained AT&T Wireless Group, respond offers AT&T Wireless Group. The AT&T Wireless Group's cellular operations experienced direct competition cellular licensee market. Beginning 1997, AT&T Wireless Group began experiencing competition license holders markets. Competition providers AT&T Wireless Group's markets continue increase networks license holders built years. In addition, FCC offer additional spectrum wireless mobile licenses future existing technologies. Cable television competes customers local markets providers entertainment, news information. The competitors markets include broadcast television radio, newspapers, magazines printed material, motion picture theatres, video cassettes sources information entertainment including directly competitive cable television operations internet service providers. The Cable Acts designed increase competition cable television industry. There alternative methods distributing similar video programming offered cable television systems. These include DBS (allowing subscriber receive video services directly satellite small dish), telephone networks (whether wireless cable, upgraded telephone networks), utility company networks, MMDS (which deliver programming services microwave channels received customers special antennas), competitive, non-exclusive franchises, city provided cable services, SMATV systems (which provide multichannel program services directly hotel, motel, apartment, condominium similar multi-unit complexes cable television system's franchise area, generally free regulation state local governmental authorities). In addition competition customers, cable television industry competes broadcast television, radio, print media sources information entertainment advertising revenue. Additionally, AT&T begins offer services high speed Internet access telephone services, significant competition local telephone companies providers services. AT&T faces significant competition expects level competition continue increase. As competitive, regulatory technological occur, including occasioned Telecommunications Act, AT&T anticipates competitors enter expand position communications services markets. These include entrants segments communications information services industry global competitors seeking expand market opportunities. Many competitors enter strong market presence, recognized names pre-existing direct customer relationships. The Telecommunications Act impacted competitive environment. Anticipating industry, non-RBOC LECs, <PAGE> required implement Telecommunications Act's competitive checklist prior offering long distance home markets, begun integrating local service offerings long distance offerings advance AT&T offering combined local long distance service areas, adversely affecting AT&T's revenues earnings service regions. In addition, Telecommunications Act permit RBOCs provide interLATA interexchange services demonstrating FCC provision public interest satisfying conditions developing local competition established Telecommunications Act. The RBOCs petitioned FCC permission provide interLATA interexchange services states home market; date FCC granted petition. In December 1999, Bell Atlantic RBOC obtain approval provide long distance state home territory, New York. In January 2000 Southwestern Bell applied FCC authorization provide long distance service Texas; law, FCC required rule application April 2000. To extent RBOCs obtain in-region interLATA authority Telecommunications Act's checklist conditions fully satisfactorily implemented adequate facilities-based local exchange competition exists, substantial risk AT&T interexchange service providers disadvantage RBOCs providing local service combined service packages. Because widely anticipated substantial numbers long distance customers seek purchase local, interexchange services single carrier part combined full service package, competitive disadvantage, inability profitably provide local service competitive rates delays limitations providing local service combined service packages adversely affect AT&T's future revenue earnings. In event, simultaneous entrance numerous competitors interexchange combined service packages adversely affect AT&T's future long distance revenue adversely affect future earnings. Furthermore, February 1997, General Agreement Trade Services (GATS) reached World Trade Organization. The GATS, effective January 1, 1998, designed open country's domestic telecommunications markets foreign competitors. The GATS, future trade agreements, accelerate entrance U.S. market foreign telecommunications providers, possess dominant home market positions effective competition. The GATS permit AT&T's entrance markets small number countries refused eliminate foreign ownership restrictions. In addition matters referred above, factors, including technological hurdles, market acceptance, start-up ongoing costs provision services local conditions obstacles, adversely affect timing success AT&T's entrance local exchange services market AT&T's ability offer combined service packages include local service. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS At December 31, 1999 AT&T employed approximately 148,000 persons operations, approximately 96.5% located domestically. About 28% domestically located employees AT&T represented unions. Of represented, 94% represented Communications Workers <PAGE> America (CWA), affiliated AFL-CIO; 5% International Brotherhood Electrical Workers (IBEW), affiliated AFL-CIO. In addition, small remainder domestic employees represented unions. Labor agreements unions extend May 2002.

We finalized strategic acquisitions announced 1998 made additional investments support facilities-based growth strategy. We continued maintain execution-focused culture AT&T. One dynamic areas 1999 wireless business. Increasing demand wireless services continued appeal Digital One Rate (sm) plans drove Wireless Services revenue grow approximately 40% year. Throughout 1999 continued expand national footprint. In quarter, completed acquisition Vanguard Cellular Systems, announced 1998; August closed acquisition Honolulu Cellular; October announced acquisition American Cellular Corp. newly created joint venture AT&T Dobson Communications. We capped year proposing creation class tracking stock reflect economic performance AT&T Wireless Group. While Wireless Group remain part AT&T, separate tracking stock provide current shareowners future investors security tied directly performance business. As worked grow wireless businesses 1999, started putting bricks mortar broadband plans - key component growth strategy. We completed $52 billion merger Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) March, quickly accelerated upgrade TCI cable plant, enable develop additional revenue streams any-distance cable telephony, high-speed data, digital video. By end 1999, TCI, renamed AT&T Broadband, offering cable telephony 16 cities pilot markets, digital-video subscribers totaled approximately 1.8 million, 200,000 customers signed high-speed data service. To expand national cable network AT&T Broadband's systems, announced May $57 billion merger MediaOne. When merger completed 2000, significantly increase presence major metropolitan markets country owned operated cable systems passing 26 million homes. In addition accomplishments domestic growth initiatives, made significant progress global strategy.

[Included 1999 Annual Report pie charts entitled "Revenue Diversification Product." These charts depict revenue product 1998 1999.] In addition delivering domestic global strategic objectives 1999, achieved aggressive financial targets set year. We <PAGE> delivered revenue growth 6.2% pro forma basis acquisitions AT&T Broadband AGNS, hitting targeted range 5% 7%. The majority increase growth businesses, showing success investment strategy begins shift revenue base long distance voice revenue. Just year ago, long distance voice revenue 75% total revenue; 1999 dropped 62%. While long distance increasingly commodity, evidenced continued pricing pressures industry, current profitability supports investments growth businesses. These growth businesses turn support long distance business include long distance component bundle competitively priced services. In order competitive, low-cost provider industry, therefore, continuing efforts reduce cost structure. A year ago, committed reducing 1999 selling, general administrative (SG&A) expenses 23% revenue. We beat target, delivering SG&A expense-to-revenue ratio 21.7% year, translates approximately $830 million SG&A expense savings compared targets. The fourth quarter 21.2%. That's dramatic improvement 1997, SG&A expense-to-revenue ratio year 27.9%. While successful driving costs business, do. We continue attack costs committed cutting $2 billion costs end 2000 continuing streamline SG&A expenses lowering network costs moving data, voice wireless traffic expanding network global facilities. Not surprisingly, success growing revenue shrinking costs allowed deliver strong cash flow results 1999, cash operations growing $11.6 billion - 13.9% 1998. In 1999, generated $18.3 billion reported EBITDA [earnings, including income (expense), interest, taxes, depreciation amortization]. As anticipated, positive impact revenue growth cost controls earnings share offset impact shares issued franchise, goodwill purchased intangibles amortization investments acquisitions. As result, earnings diluted share 10.3% 1998. We undertook aggressive stock buyback program offset dilutive impacts acquisitions, half 1998 repurchased 220 million shares, cost approximately $10 billion. In 2000, plan repurchase 50 million shares Cox Communications, Inc., exchange cable properties cash. We've long 1999.

REGULATORY MATTERS DOMESTIC PROGRAMMING In United States, FCC regulates providers satellite communications services facilities transmission programming services, cable television systems carry services, and, extent, availability programming services regulation program licensing. Cable television systems United States regulated municipalities state local government authorities. Cable television companies subject federal rate regulation provision basic service, continued rate regulation franchise conditions place downward pressure fees cable television companies pay programming services Liberty Media Group interests regulatory carriage requirements adversely affect number channels carry programming services interest. <PAGE> Regulation Program Licensing. The Cable Television Consumer Protection Competition Act 1992 (the "1992 Cable Act") directed FCC promulgate regulations sale acquisition cable programming multi-channel video programming distributors (including cable operators) satellite-delivered programming services cable operator attributable interest. The legislation implementing regulations adopted FCC preclude virtually exclusive programming contracts cable operators satellite programmers affiliated cable operator (unless FCC determines contract serves public interest) generally prohibit cable operator attributable interest satellite programmer improperly influencing terms conditions sale unaffiliated multi-channel video programming distributors. Further, 1992 Cable Act requires affiliated programmers make programming services cable operators competing multi-channel video programming distributors multi-channel multi-point distribution systems direct broadcast satellite distributors terms conditions unfairly discriminate distributors. The Telecommunications Act 1996 extended rules programming services telephone companies common carriers attributable ownership interests. The FCC revised program licensing rules, implementing damages remedy situations defendant knowingly violates regulations establishing timeline resolution complaints, things. Regulation Carriage Programming. Under 1992 Cable Act, FCC adopted regulations prohibiting cable operators requiring financial interest programming service condition carriage service, coercing exclusive rights programming service favoring affiliated programmers restrain unreasonably ability unaffiliated programmers compete. Regulation Ownership. The 1992 Cable Act required FCC, things, (a) prescribe rules regulations establishing reasonable limits number channels cable system allowed carry programming owner cable system attributable interest (b) necessity appropriateness imposing limitations degree multi-channel video programming distributors (including cable operators) engage creation production video programming. In 1993, FCC adopted regulations limiting carriage cable operator national programming services operator holds attributable interest 40% 75 activated channels cable operator's systems. The rules provide additional channels 45% limit, whichever greater, provided additional channels carry minority-controlled programming services. The regulations grandfather existing carriage arrangements exceed channel limits, require channel capacity devoted unaffiliated programming services system achieves compliance regulations. These channel occupancy limits apply 75 activated channels cable system, rules apply local regional programming services. These rules limit carriage programming companies Liberty Media Group interests systems affiliated cable operators. In rulemaking, FCC concluded additional restrictions ability multi-channel distributors engage creation production video programming unwarranted. <PAGE> The FCC's rules generally prohibit common ownership cable system broadcast television stations multichannel multi-point distribution systems ("MMDS") overlapping service areas. In August 1999, FCC revised attribution standards, implement ownership rules, adopted attribution standards based combination equity, debt indicia influence. The attribution criteria limit Liberty Media Group's ability engage transactions involving broadcast stations MMDS systems. The ownership attribution standards enforce rules, including horizontal cable system ownership, channel occupancy limits, program access program carriage rules, revised October 1999. Regulation Carriage Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act granted broadcasters choice carry rights retransmission consent rights. The rules adopted FCC generally provided mandatory carriage cable systems local full-power commercial television broadcast signals selecting carry rights and, depending cable system's channel capacity, non-commercial television broadcast signals. Such statutorily mandated carriage broadcast stations coupled provisions Cable Communications Policy Act 1984, require cable television systems 36 "activated" channels reserve percentage channels commercial unaffiliated parties permit franchise authorities require cable operator provide channel capacity, equipment facilities public, educational government access channels, adversely affect substantially programming companies Liberty Media Group interests limiting carriage services cable systems limited channel capacity. The FCC recently initiated proceeding extent cable operators carry digital signals transmitted broadcasters. The imposition additional carry regulation, conjunction current limited cable system channel capacity, make cable operators forced drop cable programming services, adverse impact programming companies Liberty Media Group interests. Closed Captioning Video Description Regulation. The Telecommunications Act 1996 required FCC establish rules implementation schedule ensure video programming fully accessible hearing impaired closed captioning. The rules adopted FCC require substantial closed captioning ten year phase-in period limited exemptions. As result, programming companies Liberty Media Group interests expected incur significant additional costs closed captioning. In November 1999, FCC issued notice proposed rulemaking require broadcasters largest national video programming services begin provide audio descriptions visual events visually impaired secondary audio program. Depending final requirements rule, increased costs programmers result. Copyright Regulation. Satellite carriers, TV Guide's UVTV division, retransmit broadcast signals "superstations," KWGN WGN, network stations home satellite dish owners private home viewing statutory license pursuant Satellite Home Viewer Act 1994 (the "SHV Act"). The Intellectual Property Communications Omnibus Reform Act 1999 ("IPCORA"), enacted law November 1999, extends SHV Act license December 31, 2004. Under SHV Act, satellite carriers previously paid monthly fee 27 cents subscriber secondary <PAGE> transmission distant superstations distant network stations. However, IPCORA decreased royalty fee distant superstations 30% distant network stations 45%. To extent satellite carriers transmit superstation network station signals cable operators, cable operators pay copyright fee separate compulsory license. Satellite carriers distribute signals network broadcast stations, distinguished superstations, "unserved households" Grade B contours station affiliated network. IPCORA requires FCC conduct number rulemaking proceedings ultimately subject superstations distant network stations delivered satellite directly dish owners program exclusivity rules (similar imposed cable operators), including syndicated exclusivity, network non-duplication sports blackout rules. The FCC commence rule makings review signal strength measurement subscriber eligibility standards. The legislation copyright liability moratorium satellite carriers distributing distant network signals existing (as October 31, 1999) recently terminated (after July 1, 1998) subscribers Grade B contours local network affiliates. Moreover, entire C-band satellite industry exempt restrictions delivering distant network signals subscribers received C-band service October 31, 1999. IPCORA rulemakings, exemptions, regulatory requirements adopted substantially impact C-band DBS industry, potentially affecting economics uplinking distributing distant network stations superstations dish owners. A subsidiary TV Guide entered agreement National Association Broadcasters, ABC, CBS, NBC networks, affiliate associations, hundred broadcast stations identify zip code geographic areas "unserved" network affiliated stations May 1998. With passage IPCORA, subsidiary opted discontinue agreement. The broadcasters have, however, objected termination asserted claims liquidated damages damages result failure terminate distant network signal subscribers period September, 1999 passage IPCORA termination agreement. Satellites Uplink. In general, authorization FCC obtained construction operation communications satellite. The FCC authorizes utilization satellite orbital slots assigned United States World Administrative Radio Conference. Such slots finite number, limiting number carriers provide satellite transponders number transponders transmission programming services. At present, however, numerous competing satellite service providers make transponders video services cable industry. Proposed Changes Regulation. The regulation programming services, cable television systems, satellite carriers television stations subject political process constant flux past decade. Further material law regulatory requirements anticipated assurance Liberty Media Group's business adversely affected future legislation, regulation deregulation. DOMESTIC TELEPHONY The FCC regulates licensing, construction, operation, acquisition, resale interconnection arrangements domestic wireless telecommunications systems. The activities wireless service providers, Sprint PCS <PAGE> Group, subject regulation varying degrees, depending jurisdiction, state local regulatory agencies well. The FCC, conjunction U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, regulates tower marking lighting, FCC environmental rules PCS network facilities subject regulation National Environmental Policy Act National Historic Preservation Act. INTERNATIONAL CABLE, TELEPHONY PROGRAMMING Some foreign countries Liberty Media Group has, proposes make, investment regulate, varying degrees, (a) granting cable telephony franchises, construction cable telephony systems operations cable, multi-channel television operators telephony operators service providers, acquisition of, foreign investments in, operators service providers, (b) distribution content programming Internet services foreign investment programming companies. Regulations laws cover wireline wireless telephony, satellite cable communications Internet services, others. Regulations laws exist time Liberty Media Group makes investment foreign subsidiary business affiliate change, assurance material adverse regulation services provided Liberty Media Group's subsidiaries business affiliates occur future. Regulation form price controls, service requirements programming content restrictions, others. Moreover, countries issue exclusive licenses provide multi-channel television services geographic area, instances Liberty Media Group adversely affected overbuild competing cable operators. In countries multi-channel television developed, minimal regulation cable television, and, hence, protections cable operator's investment United States countries (such rights renewal franchises utility pole attachment) countries. INTERNET SERVICES The Internet companies interests subject, directly indirectly, laws governmental regulations relating respective businesses. There laws regulations directly applicable access commerce commercial online services Internet. For example, Digital Millennium Copyright Act, enacted law 1998, protects qualifying online service providers copyright infringement liability, Internet Tax Freedom Act, enacted 1998, year moratorium state local taxes Internet access commerce, Communications Decency Act, Internet service provider treated publisher speaker information provided information content provider. However, due increasing popularity commercial online services Internet, number laws regulations adopted respect commercial online services Internet. Such laws regulations cover issues user privacy, defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing characteristics quality products services. The adoption laws regulations future slow growth commercial online services Internet, turn decline demand services products Internet companies interests increase companies' costs business adverse effect businesses, operating results financial conditions. <PAGE> Moreover, applicability commercial online services Internet existing laws governing issues property ownership, libel, personal privacy taxation uncertain expose companies substantial liability. BROADCASTERS Liberty Media Group nonattributable minority ownership interests group owners broadcast television radio stations. The FCC extensively regulates ownership operation stations variety rules. COMPETITION Programming. The business distributing programming cable satellite television highly competitive, United States foreign countries. The programming companies interests directly compete programmers distribution limited number channels. Once distribution obtained, programming services business affiliates' programming services compete, varying degrees, viewers advertisers cable off-air broadcast television programming services entertainment media, including home video (generally video rentals), pay-per-view services, online activities, movies forms news, information entertainment.

Many competitors operating number years service significant subscriber base. <PAGE> Internet Services Technology. The markets Internet services, online content products new, intensely competitive rapidly changing.
