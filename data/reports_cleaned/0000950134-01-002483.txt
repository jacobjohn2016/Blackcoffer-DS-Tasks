COMPETITION Most major air carriers developed hub-and-spoke systems schedule patterns effort maximize revenue potential service. American operates hubs: Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago O'Hare, Miami San Juan, Puerto Rico. Delta Air Lines United Airlines hub operations DFW Chicago O'Hare, respectively. The American Eagle carriers increase number markets Company serves providing connections American American's hubs major airports. The American Eagle carriers serve smaller markets Boston, DFW, Chicago, Miami, San Juan, Los Angeles New York's LaGuardia John F. Kennedy International Airports. American's competitors marketing agreements regional carriers provide similar services major hubs. 2 <PAGE> 4 In addition extensive domestic service, Company international service Caribbean, Canada, Latin America, Europe Pacific. The Company's operating revenues foreign operations approximately $5.8 billion 2000, $5.2 billion 1999 $5.3 billion 1998. Additional information Company's foreign operations included Note 13 consolidated financial statements. The domestic airline industry fiercely competitive. Currently, carrier deemed fit U.S. Department Transportation (DOT) free operate scheduled passenger service points U.S. possessions. On domestic non-stop routes, Company faces competing service one, one, major domestic airline including: Alaska Airlines, America West Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TWA, United, US Airways affiliated regional carriers. Competition greater cities require connection, airlines compete respective hubs. The Company competes national, regional, all-cargo charter carriers and, shorter segments, ground transportation. In addition, routes, pricing decisions affected, part, competition airlines, cost structures significantly lower American's operate profitably lower fare levels. The majority tickets travel American American Eagle sold travel agents. Domestic travel agents generally receive base commission percent price tickets sell. This amount capped maximum $50 domestic roundtrip itinerary $100 international roundtrip itinerary. Airlines pay additional commissions connection special revenue programs. Accordingly, airlines compete respect price tickets sold respect amount commissions paid. The growing electronic distribution systems Company ever-increasing ability lower distribution costs. The Company continues expand capabilities Internet website - AA.com - electronic ticketing Company's network. In addition, Company entered agreements Internet travel providers, including Travelocity.com, Expedia, priceline.com Hotwire. The base commission sales Internet travel providers significantly lower traditional travel agencies. International air transportation subject extensive government regulation. In providing international air transportation, American competes foreign investor-owned carriers, state-owned carriers U.S. airlines granted authority provide scheduled passenger cargo service U.S. overseas locations. American's operating authority markets subject aviation agreements U.S. respective countries, cases, fares schedules require approval and/or relevant foreign governments. Because international air transportation governed bilateral agreements U.S. foreign country countries involved, U.S. foreign government aviation policies result alteration termination agreements, diminish route authorities, adversely affect American's international operations. Bilateral agreements U.S. foreign countries served American subject frequent renegotiation. In addition, foreign airports, carrier slots (landing take-off authorizations) carrier introduce service increase existing service. The availability slots assured inhibit carrier's efforts compete markets. The major U.S. carriers advantage foreign competitors ability generate traffic extensive domestic route systems. In cases, however, foreign governments, subsidize American's foreign competitors, limit U.S. carriers' rights carry passengers designated gateway cities foreign countries. To improve access other's markets, U.S. foreign carriers -- including American -- established marketing relationships airlines. American code-sharing programs Aer Lingus, Air Pacific, Alaska Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Eastern Airlines, Air, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Airlines, LanChile, LOT Polish Airlines, Qantas Airways, Sabena, SNCF, Swissair, TACA Group, Group, TAP Air Portugal, Thalys Turkish Airlines. American Eagle code-sharing programs Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, TWA Midwest Express, addition code-sharing American's code-share partners. Certain relationships include reciprocity American airlines' frequent flyer programs. In addition, Company expects implement expand alliances international carriers, including British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, 3 <PAGE> 5 Eastern Airlines Qantas New Zealand, pending regulatory approval. In coming years, Company expects develop programs evaluate alliances international carriers. In February 1999, American, British Airways, Canadian Airlines International Limited (Canadian), Cathay Pacific Airways Qantas Airways formed global alliance ONEworld(TM). In September 1999, founding members joined Finnair Iberia. Also, June 2000, Aer Lingus LanChile joined ONEworld alliance. The ONEworld alliance links networks member carriers enhance customer service smooth connections destinations served alliance, including linking carriers' frequent flyer programs access carriers' airport lounge facilities. Following acquisition Canadian Air Canada, Canadian terminated membership ONEworld June 2000. The Company believes advantages relative competition. Its fleet efficient quiet, youngest fleets U.S. airline industry. It comprehensive domestic international route structure, anchored efficient hubs, permit full advantage traffic growth occurs. The Company believes American's AAdvantage frequent flyer program, largest program industry, More Room Throughout Coach program superior service give competitive advantage competition. REGULATION GENERAL The Airline Deregulation Act 1978, amended, eliminated domestic economic regulation passenger freight transportation. However, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority air carriers. The maintains jurisdiction approval international codeshare agreements, international route authorities consumer protection matters, advertising, denied boarding compensation baggage liability. The FAA regulates flying operations generally, including establishing personnel, aircraft security standards. As part oversight, FAA implemented number requirements American incorporating maintenance program. These matters relate to, things, inspection maintenance aging aircraft, corrosion control, installation upgraded digital flight data recorders, enhanced ground proximity warning systems, cargo compartment smoke detection fire suppression systems, McDonnell Douglas MD 80 metal-mylar insulation replacement, required inspections General Electric compressor spools. Based current implementation schedule, American expects compliance applicable requirements required time periods. The DOJ jurisdiction airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service jurisdiction aspects transportation mail related services. Labor relations air transportation industry regulated Railway Labor Act, vests National Mediation Board regulatory functions respect disputes airlines labor unions relating union representation collective bargaining agreements. To extent American continues increase alliances international carriers, American subject regulations foreign agencies. In April 1998, issued proposed pricing capacity rules severely limit major carriers' ability compete entrant carriers. In January 2001, multi-year investigation public docket competition major carriers entrant carriers, restated concerns competitive practices industry, declined issue specific competitive guidelines. In statement findings conclusions, reiterated view authority obligation prevent considers unfair competitive practices industry, intent pursue enforcement actions case-by-case basis. To extent future enforcement actions directly indirectly impose restrictions American's ability respond competitors, American's business adversely impacted. As Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Antitrust Division DOJ purported classes private parties pursuing litigation alleging American violated federal antitrust laws competing carriers. Although Company believes litigation merit, adverse court decisions impose restrictions American's ability respond competitors, American's business adversely impacted. 4 <PAGE> 6 AIRLINE FARES Airlines permitted establish domestic fares governmental regulation, industry characterized substantial price competition. The maintains authority international fares, rates charges. International fares rates subject jurisdiction governments foreign countries American serves. While air carriers required file adhere international fare rate tariffs, substantial commissions, overrides discounts travel agents, brokers wholesalers characterize international markets. Legislation (sometimes referred "Passengers' Bill Rights") discussed legislatures (including Congress). This legislation could, enacted, (i) place limitations airline fares and/or (ii) affect operating practices baggage handling overbooking. Effective December 15, 1999, Company, domestic airlines, implemented Customer Service Plan address number service goals, including, limited (i) lowest fare availability, (ii) delays, cancellations, diversion events, (iii) baggage delivery liability, (iv) guaranteed fares, (v) ticket refunds, (vi) accommodation customers special needs, (vii) essential customer extraordinary delays, (viii) flight oversales, (ix) Frequent Flyer Program - AAdvantage, (x) travel policies, (xi) service domestic code share partners, (xii) handling customer issues. In February 2001, Inspector General issued report carriers' performance Customer Service Plans. The report included number recommendations limit American's flexibility respect operational practices. In February 2001, bill proposing "Airline Customer Service Improvement Act" introduced United States Senate. In addition, items legislation introduced limit hub concentration, reallocate slots airports impose higher landing fees hours. To extent legislation enacted inhibit American's flexibility respect fares, revenue management system, operations aspects customer service operations, American's financial results adversely affected. Fare discounting competitors historically negative effect Company's financial results Company generally required match competitors' fares maintain passenger traffic. During recent years, number low-cost airlines entered domestic market major airlines, including American, implemented efforts lower cost structures. Further fare reductions, domestic international, occur future. If fare reductions offset increases passenger traffic, cost reductions mix traffic improves yields, Company's operating results negatively impacted. AIRPORT ACCESS In 1968, FAA issued rule designating New York John F. Kennedy, New York LaGuardia, Washington Reagan, Chicago O'Hare Newark airports high-density traffic airports. Newark subsequently removed high-density airport classification. The high-density rule (HDR) limits number Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations - take-offs landings - permitted hour requires slot support operation. In April 2000, legislation signed (i) eliminate slot restrictions New York's John F. Kennedy LaGuardia airports 2007, (ii) shrink Chicago O'Hare's slot day 0645 - 2114 hours 1445 - 2014 hours starting July 2001, (iii) eliminate Chicago O'Hare slots July 2002. The Company expect elimination slot restrictions material adverse impact Company's operations financial condition result operations. Pursuant Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment Reform Act 21st Century (Air 21 Act), slot restrictions lifted service to/from LaGuardia cities classified small non-hub airports (new service cities). This increase service operated regional jets. As consequence, Company carriers increased service LaGuardia service cities. In December 2000, held lottery LaGuardia slots service service cities order ease congestion airport. The congestion direct result growth Air 21 Act slot operations. While Company scaled back service service cities to/from LaGuardia, anticipated reduction material impact Company's operations financial condition result operations. At December 31, 2000, net book Company's slots New York John F. Kennedy, New York LaGuardia Chicago O'Hare airports approximately $183 million. Currently, FAA permits purchasing, selling, leasing transferring slots slots designated international, essential air service Air 21 Act. Trading slot permitted subject parameters. Most foreign airports, including London Heathrow, major European destination American, slot allocations. Most foreign authorities permit purchasing, selling leasing slots. 5 <PAGE> 7 Although Company constrained slots, sufficient slot authorizations operate existing flights generally obtain slots expand operations change schedules. However, assurance Company obtain slots purposes future because, factors, domestic slot allocations subject government policies. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company subject laws government regulations environmental matters employee safety health U.S. countries. U.S. federal laws impact Company include Airport Noise Capacity Act 1990 (ANCA), Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation Recovery Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act (CERCLA Superfund Act). The Company subject oversight Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) employee safety health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, federal agencies authorized promulgate regulations impact Company's operations. In addition federal activities, states delegated authorities aforementioned federal statutes. Many state local governments adopted environmental employee safety health laws regulations, similar federal requirements. As part continuing safety, health environmental program, Company anticipates comply requirements material adverse effect business. The ANCA recognizes rights airport operators noise problems implement local noise abatement programs long interfere unreasonably interstate foreign commerce national air transportation system. Authorities cities promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs, including imposition nighttime curfews. The ANCA generally requires FAA approval local noise restrictions aircraft. While American sufficient scheduling flexibility accommodate local noise restrictions imposed date, American's operations adversely affected locally-imposed regulations restrictive widespread. American identified EPA potentially responsible party (PRP) Operating Industries, Inc. Superfund Site California. American signed partial consent decree respect site PRPs named. American identified PRP Beede Waste Oil Superfund Site New Hampshire. American responded 104(e) Request Information interaction companies related site. At Operating Industries, Inc. Beede Waste Oil sites, American's alleged waste disposal volumes minor compared PRPs sites. In 1998, EPA named American de minimis PRP Casmalia Waste Disposal Site California. American, tenants San Francisco International Airport (SFIA), ordered California Regional Water Quality Control Board engage studies potential environmental contamination airport undertake remedial measures, necessary. SFIA seeking recover past costs related contamination tenants. The Miami International Airport Authority remediating environmental conditions Miami International Airport (the Airport) funding remediation costs landing fee revenues cost recovery methods. Future costs remediation effort borne carriers operating Airport, including American, increased landing fees and/or charges PRPs longer business. The future increase landing fees and/or charges material estimated due factors, including unknown extent remedial actions required, proportion cost ultimately recovered responsible parties, uncertainties environmental agencies ultimately supervise remedial activities nature supervision. In 1999, American ordered New York State Department Environmental Conservation conduct remediation environmental contamination located Terminals 8 9 New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. American seeking recover portion related costs previous users premises. 6 <PAGE> 8 Also 1999, Company entered plea agreement United States government respect count indictment relating storage hazardous materials. As part plea agreement, Company probation years adopted comprehensive compliance program. To extent Company fails abide terms probation compliance program, Company's operations adversely impacted. American Executive Airlines, Inc., tenants Luis Munoz Marin International Airport San Juan, Puerto Rico, named PRPs environmental claims airport.

FUEL The Company's operations significantly affected availability price jet fuel. The Company's fuel costs consumption years 1998 2000 were: <TABLE> <CAPTION> Average Cost Per Gallon, Percent Gallons Average Cost Excluding AMR's Consumed Total Cost Per Gallon Fuel Taxes Operating Year (in millions) (in millions) (in cents) (in cents) Expenses - ---- ------------- ------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> 1998 2,922 $1,604 54.9 50.2 10.3 1999 3,084 1,696 55.0 50.4 10.2 2000 3,197 2,495 78.1 72.8 13.6 </TABLE> The impact fuel price Company competitors dependent factors, including hedging strategies. The Company fuel hedging program enters fuel swap option contracts protect increases jet fuel prices, effect dampening Company's average cost gallon. During 2000, Company's fuel hedging program reduced Company's fuel expense approximately $545 million. To reduce impact potential continuing fuel price increases 2001, Company hedged approximately 40 percent 2001 fuel requirements December 31, 2000. Based projected fuel usage, Company estimates 10 percent increase price gallon fuel result increase aircraft fuel expense approximately $194 million 2001, net fuel hedge instruments outstanding December 31, 2000. The analysis excludes impact proposed transactions discussed pages 1 2. Due competitive nature airline industry, event continuing increases price jet fuel, assurance Company pass increased fuel prices customers increasing fares. Likewise, potential benefit lower fuel prices offset increased fare competition lower revenues air carriers. 8 <PAGE> 10 While Company anticipate significant reduction fuel availability, dependency foreign imports crude oil possibility government policy jet fuel production, transportation marketing make impossible predict future availability jet fuel. If major reductions availability jet fuel, Company's business adversely affected. Additional information Company's fuel program included Outlook 2001, Item 7(A) - Quantitative Qualitative Disclosures Market Risk, Note 6 consolidated financial statements. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM American established AAdvantage frequent flyer program (AAdvantage) develop passenger loyalty offering awards travelers continued patronage.
