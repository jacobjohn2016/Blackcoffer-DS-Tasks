The issue Y2K program addresses two-digit year field four-digit year field computer systems. If computer systems distinguish year 1900 year 2000, system failures computer errors result. The potential failures errors spans aspects business, including computer systems, voice data networks, building infrastructures. We faced addressing interdependencies suppliers, connecting carriers major customers, face issue. AT&T's company-wide Y2K program focused interrelated categories critical maintaining uninterrupted service customers: AT&T-developed applications external interfaces, AT&T networks, information-technology (IT) platforms support applications, non-IT infrastructure. AT&T's progress Y2K program measured key milestones phases common category systems. These milestones are: assessment, repair/remediation, testing certification. AT&T monitors tracks progress Y2K program series scorecards capture activities related Y2K process phases. As September 30, 1999, AT&T's network services AT&T-developed applications external interfaces year 2000 compliant. This means assessed year 2000 impacts, repaired necessary, tested fully deployed. Within IT-infrastructure category, non-critical desktops remain certified small number sites remain certified non-IT infrastructure category. The certification remaining desktops sites expected completed November 1999. The status AB&IS' Y2K program discussed separately existing AT&T program. All targets cited exclude information pending acquisitions, programs continue evaluated planned integration AT&T Y2K program. Program Status AT&T 3,500 applications (1) directly support AT&T's voice data telecommunications services (including wired wireless); (2) critical provisioning, administration, maintenance customer service/support related telecommunications services; (3) support sales marketing organizations, AT&T services internal administrative functions. These applications represent 385 million lines code. As September 30, 1999, applications 100% complaint. With respect external (third-party) interface assessment, formal letters 2,000 domestic telecommunications companies international telecommunications authorities request information Y2K plans targets compliance. We identified 1,000 types third-party interfaces 10,000 total instances types. As September 30, 1999, AT&T 100% complete Y2K certification external interfaces. <PAGE> AT&T Form 10-Q - Part The AT&T network critical providing top-quality, reliable service AT&T customers. As September 30, 1999, assessment, repair certification phases operation-support systems (OS) 100% complete systems fully deployed. In addition AT&T-developed applications supporting network, AT&T inventoried 2,000 unique types (manufactured/model combinations) externally purchased network elements (NE) including switches, routers, network-control points signal-transfer points. Additional Y2K testing conducted independently verify supplier claims compliance. All NEs certified. After OS/NE certification complete, AT&T performs integration testing verify Y2K certification NEs conjunction OS applications. Such integration testing 100% completed, NEs fully deployed. The infrastructure category addresses computing platforms critical AT&T-developed applications, common modules, communications protocols, internal AT&T wide-area local-area networks, desktop hardware/software internal voice network. As September 30, 1999, AT&T 100% compliant computing platforms, 95% compliant desktops, 100% compliant voice systems adjuncts, 100% compliant data networks. The desktops remain validated Y2K compliant customer-affecting areas. Based experience desktops verified compliant, remaining desktops require software "patches" minimal upgrades made compliant. We anticipate complete validation process end November 1999. The non-IT infrastructure focuses energy- environment-management systems critical computer systems, safety, security operations. This aspect Y2K program encompasses 18,000 sites, including thousands repeater huts, radio towers wireless cell sites. As September 30, 1999, 100% sites completed inventory assessment 97% compliant (or impacted). The small number sites remain certified compliant anticipated completed mid-November 1999. In addition, AT&T virtually completed network interoperability tests variety domestic international testing partners, remaining tests scheduled completed November. These tests designed exercise network range vendors, range AT&T voice, private line, data services. We completed testing key customer industry segments, including financial community, insurance, power utilities, federal government others. All test results date positive. Similar AT&T's Y2K program, AB&IS program four-phased approach determining readiness systems Y2K, namely: assessment, remediation, testing implementation. As September 30, 1999, critical cable delivery systems customer services Y2K compliant. We anticipate completion remaining phases AB&IS' program mid-November. AB&IS continuing efforts verify year 2000 readiness significant suppliers vendors continue communicate significant business partners affiliates assess partners' affiliates' Y2K status. <PAGE> AT&T Form 10-Q - Part Costs We expended approximately $675 million inception 1997 phases Y2K project. This figure included approximately $76 million costs incurred quarter 1999, approximately $11 million represented capital spending upgrading replacing non-compliant computer systems network components. Less half 1999 costs incurred date represent internal resources redeployed projects expected return projects completion Y2K project. We anticipate remaining Y2K costs 1999, inclusive approximately $25 million projected expenditures completing AB&IS program, approximately $64 million. This projection includes approximately $21 million capitalized costs. The remaining projected expenditures consist primarily continued independent verification validation; contingency planning testing; completion document retention requirements continued communications expansion enhancement. Risk Assessment We assessed business exposure result failure Y2K program, suppliers, connecting carriers major customers. Such failures result business consequences include failure serve customers, loss network functionality, inability render accurate bills, lost revenues, harm AT&T brand, legal regulatory exposure, failure management controls. Although internal Y2K compliance achieved December 31, 1999, assurance Y2K problem material adverse effect business, financial condition results operations. <PAGE> AT&T Form 10-Q - Part Contingency Plans AT&T's contingency planning program focuses 38 critical business processes designated "important" "support".
