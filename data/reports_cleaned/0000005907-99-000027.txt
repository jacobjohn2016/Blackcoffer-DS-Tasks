The issue Y2K program addresses two-digit year field four-digit year field computer systems. If computer systems distinguish year 1900 year 2000, system failures computer errors result. The potential failures errors spans aspects business, including computer systems, voice data networks, building infrastructures. We faced addressing interdependencies suppliers, connecting carriers major customers, face issue. <PAGE> AT&T Form 10-Q - Part AT&T's company-wide Y2K program focused interrelated categories critical maintaining uninterrupted service customers: AT&T-developed applications external interfaces, AT&T networks, information-technology (IT) platforms support applications, non-IT infrastructure.

The certification deployment applications targeted completion quarter 1999. With respect external (third-party) interface assessment, formal letters 2,000 domestic telecommunications companies international telecommunications authorities request information Y2K plans targets compliance. We identified 1,000 types third-party interfaces 10,000 total instances types. As June 30, 1999, AT&T assessed approximately 99% third-party interface types, approximately 98% Y2K compliant. We expect 100% complete Y2K certification external interfaces quarter 1999. The AT&T network critical providing top-quality, reliable service AT&T customers.

CostsWe expended approximately $600 million inception 1997 phases Y2K project. This figure includes approximately $98 million costs incurred quarter 1999, approximately $14 million represented capital spending upgrading replacing non-compliant computer systems network components. Less half 1999 costs represent internal resources redeployed projects expected return projects completion Y2K project. We anticipate remaining Y2K costs 1999, inclusive approximately $69 million projected expenditures completing TCI program, approximately $156 million.
