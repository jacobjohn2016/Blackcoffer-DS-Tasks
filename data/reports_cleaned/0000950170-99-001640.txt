SUNBEAM'S APPROACH 2000 ISSUES While Company's Year 2000 readiness planning underway year, quarter 1998 Company established cross-functional project team consisting senior managers, assisted external consulting firms retained provide consulting services assist Company implementing Year 2000 strategy. This team sponsored Company's Chief Financial Officer reports directly Company's Chief Executive Officer issue.

Recognizing dependent entire company IT, Sunbeam decided 1997 replace primary business applications uniform international business accounting information system address systems applications listed improve internal reporting processes. Based representations manufacturer current version uniform information system Year 2000 ready, Company actively upgrading business sites utilize uniform system Year 2000 ready version. In addition pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations utilized earlier non-Year 2000 ready version uniform business accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee, Health-o-Meter Sunbeam Latin America replacing current non-Year 2000 ready systems uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe replacing key business components system.

For example, Coleman approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs lieu Sunbeam's uniform business accounting information system remediated tested Year 2000 ready. With respect Company's non-IT systems (for example, time attendance, security, in-line manufacturing hardware) Company actively analyzing items assess Year 2000 issues. To date, material issues discovered, Company continue review, test correct, necessary, items. 25 <PAGE> Sunbeam largely implemented corrective work expects complete final testing implementation systems quarter early fourth quarter 1999. PHASE 3 - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS BUSINESS PARTNERS: The phase Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program initiated fourth quarters 1998 designed assess interact Company's customers, suppliers, business partners. As part effort, Company surveyed 1,100 vendors suppliers, portion provide initial response. During half 1999, "high risk" vendors contacted directly number non-respondents decreased substantially. In fact, 7% Company's vendors surveyed categorized "high risk" includes non-respondents. Based recent responses survey continued evaluation, Company believes low medium risk Year 2000 issues remaining vendors. The Company continue monitor Year 2000 progress "high risk" vendors re-surveyed companies determine action. Furthermore, Company process contacting alternate vendors Year 2000 ready replace critical vendors deemed "high risk" event vendors found Year 2000 ready.

The Company's Year 2000 readiness program ongoing ultimate scope, consideration contingency plans, continue evaluated information available. The Company designed Year 2000 contingency plan process implementing it. The development contingency plan included process Company's critical non-IT systems evaluated Year 2000 readiness. As result evaluation, Company expect require additional operational equipment significant process contingency measures. Although Company significant risk party suppliers, contingency plan includes continuing evaluation readiness Company's suppliers consideration Company's inventory requirements protect supply disruption. This evaluation process result increase inventory months 1999. RISKS SUNBEAM'S 2000 APPROACH The independent consultants assisting Company Year 2000 readiness program reviewed concurred Company's approach, assisted developing cost estimates monitored costs largest single component (upgrade installation Company's uniform system) Company's Year 2000 program. Since Sunbeam's Year 2000 program developed monitored independent consultants, Company engage independent party verify program's approach total cost Company believes Company's exposure regard mitigated. In addition, external third-party diagnostic software packages designed analyze Year 2000 readiness business software programs, Company identify potential Year 2000 issues Coleman. Given this, Company believes mitigated risk validating verifying key program components. Management believes that, significant systems modified replaced, including uniform business accounting information system, Sunbeam's information systems environment made Year 2000 ready prior January 1, 2000. Sunbeam's failure timely complete corrective work material adverse impact Company. With respect customers, suppliers business partners, failure parties Year 2000 ready material adverse impact Sunbeam. For example, failure Company's principal suppliers Year 2000 ready internal systems impact Company's ability manufacture and/or ship products maintain adequate inventory levels production. At time, Company believes "worst-case" scenario relating Year 2000 involves potential disruptions areas Company's operations rely parties, suppliers, systems work properly January 1, 2000. While system failures directly indirectly affect important operations Company subsidiaries significant manner, Company present estimate likelihood potential cost failures. Subject nature goods services provided Company parties operations made ready Year 2000 issues, impact Sunbeam's operations material contingency plans developed prior January 1, 2000. The nature focus Company's efforts address Year 2000 problem revised periodically interim goals achieved issues identified. In addition, important note description Company's efforts assessments necessarily involves estimates projections respect activities required future. These estimates projections subject change work continues, substantial. 26 <PAGE> COSTS ADDRESS COMPANY'S 2000 ISSUES During quarter ended March 31, 1999, Sunbeam expended approximately $17 million address Year 2000 issues approximately 50% recorded capital expenditures remainder SG&A expense.

A large majority costs expected incremental expenditures recur Year 2000 thereafter. Fees expenses related party consultants, involved PMO modification replacement software, represent approximately 75% total estimated cost.

A significant portion expenditures enhance Sunbeam's operating systems addition resolving Year 2000 issues. As Sunbeam completes assessment Year 2000 issues, actual expenditures incurred incurred differ materially amounts shown above. The bank credit facility permit Company spend $50 million Year 2000 testing remediation 1999. Because Year 2000 readiness critical business, Sunbeam redeployed resources non-critical system enhancements address Year 2000 issues. In addition, due importance systems Company's business, management deferred non-critical systems enhancements possible. The Company expect redeployments deferrals material impact Company's financial condition, results operations, cash flows.
