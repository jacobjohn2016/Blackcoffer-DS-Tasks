As AMR Eagle continues accept previously ordered regional jets, ASM cap reached 2002, necessitating actions insure compliance ASM cap. These actions additional potential actions respect ASM cap discussed Company's 2001 Form 10-K. In addition, American removed code flights AmericanConnection carriers, independent carriers provide feed American's St. Louis hub, continue remove codes additional flights carriers warranted. American believes combination actions enable continue comply ASM cap 2002 beyond. In addition, provision current APA contract limits total number regional jets 44 seats flown American code American's regional carrier partners 67 aircraft. Similar above, AMR Eagle continues accept previously ordered Bombardier CRJ aircraft, cap reached early 2003. In order ensure American remains compliance provision, AMR Eagle reached agreement principle dispose 14 Embraer 145 aircraft.

AMR Eagle's fourth quarter capacity ten percent year's levels, percent fourth quarter 2000. For fourth quarter 2002, Company expects traffic approximately thirteen percent year's fourth quarter levels, 15 percent fourth quarter 2000. Pressure reduce costs continue, Company continue higher benefit security costs, increased insurance premiums, greater interest expense. In addition, Company expects 23 percent increase fuel prices compared fourth quarter 2001 continued decline commission expense due commission implemented earlier 2002. In total, American's unit costs, excluding special charges, fourth quarter 2002 expected approximately percent year's fourth quarter level. Notwithstanding expected decrease unit costs however, revenue pressures expected continue fourth quarter current level fuel prices, Company expects incur significant loss fourth quarter, excess quarter loss excluding special charges. In response financial challenges, Company continuing comprehensive review business align cost structure current revenue environment, aimed improving productivity, simplifying operations reducing costs. In addition, August 13, 2002, Company announced series short- long- term initiatives reduce costs, reduce capacity, simplify aircraft fleet, enhance productivity. These initiatives include, things, de-peaking Company's Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport hub (following de-peaking Chicago hub April 2002) scheduling flights hub continuously, flights spread evenly day; gradually phasing operation Fokker aircraft fleet 2005; reducing capacity fourth quarter 2002. By de-peaking Dallas/Fort Worth Chicago hubs Company believes productively employees, gates, aircraft. In addition, Company announced reduce estimated 7,000 jobs March 2003 realign workforce planned capacity reductions, fleet simplification, hub restructurings. American subsequently announced expects full year capacity 2003 percent 2002, giving effect capacity reduction above. Although American expects initiatives improve efficiency reduce operating costs, assurance initiatives successful sufficient. RISK FACTORS As result weak domestic international economic conditions, reduced fares, terrorist attacks September 11, 2001, airline industry suffered substantial losses 2001, expected suffer significant losses 2002.

More recently, United Air Lines, Inc. (United), largest domestic air carrier, publicly stated that, realize substantial cost savings current cost savings initiatives, forced reorganize Bankruptcy Code. Successful completion reorganizations present American competitors significantly lower operating costs derived labor, supply, financing contracts renegotiated protection Bankruptcy Code. In addition, historically, air carriers involved reorganizations undertaken substantial fare discounting order maintain cash flows enhance continued customer loyalty. Such fare discounting lower yields carriers, including American. Further, market aircraft negatively impacted number air carriers, including US Airways United, seek reduce capacity eliminating aircraft fleets. Moreover, increased threat U.S. military involvement overseas operations (including, example, hostilities threat war Iraq) material adverse impact Company's business, financial position (including access capital markets) results operations airline industry general. -19- <Page> 22 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Statements report forward-looking statements meaning Section 27A Securities Act 1933, amended, Section 21E Securities Exchange Act 1934, amended, represent Company's expectations beliefs future events.
