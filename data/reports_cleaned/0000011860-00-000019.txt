Capital expenditures 2000 estimated $250 million. During 1998, Bethlehem started construction Sparrows Point's continuous cold rolling mill complex. This complex, scheduled begin production early 2000, expected lower costs, improve quality enhance capabilities. About $350 million capital expenditures authorized 1999. At December 31, 1999, estimated cost completing authorized capital expenditures $410 million compared $610 million December 31, 1998. Bethlehem expects complete authorized capital expenditures 2000 2002. The domestic integrated steel industry capital intensive. As discussed "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES -- General" Report, Bethlehem's principal operations facilities varying ages, technologies operating efficiencies. Bethlehem continue make significant capital expenditures future maintain improve competitiveness operations facilities. Environment Bethlehem subject federal, state local environmental laws regulations concerning, things, air emissions, waste water discharges solid hazardous waste disposal. During years ended December 31, 1999, Bethlehem spent $100 million environmental control equipment. Expenditures environmental control equipment totaled approximately $11 million 1999, $13 million 1998 $15 million 1997. The costs incurred 1999 operate maintain existing environmental control equipment approximately $115 million (excluding interest costs including depreciation charges $14 million) compared $114 million 1998 $112 million 1997. In addition, Bethlehem required pay fines penalties relating violations alleged violations laws regulations environmental control area. Bethlehem paid $74,000 1999, $910,000 1998 $830,000 1997 fines penalties. Under Clean Air Act, amended, coke-making facilities meet progressively stringent standards 25 years. Bethlehem operates coke-making facilities Burns Harbor, Indiana Lackawanna, New York. Bethlehem continue evaluate impact future emission control regulations Burns Harbor Lackawanna operations believes operations comply. Bethlehem federal state regulatory agencies conduct negotiations resolve differences interpretation environmental control requirements. In instances, negotiations held connection resolution pending environmental proceedings. Bethlehem believes significant curtailment interruptions important operations result proceedings negotiations. Bethlehem predict future specific environmental control requirements. Based existing anticipated regulations current legislation, Bethlehem estimates capital expenditures environmental control equipment average $15 million year years. However, estimates future capital expenditures operating costs required environmental compliance subject numerous uncertainties, including evolving nature regulations, imposition stringent requirements, availability technologies timing expenditures. 5 <PAGE> Under Resource Conservation Recovery Act, amended ("RCRA"), owners facilities managed hazardous waste 1980 required investigate and, appropriate, remediate historic environmental contamination found facility. All Bethlehem's major facilities subject "Corrective Action Program", Bethlehem implemented implementing program facilities located Steelton, Pennsylvania; Lackawanna, New York; Burns Harbor, Indiana; Sparrows Point, Maryland. At Steelton, Bethlehem completed RCRA Facility Investigation ("RFI"), Corrective Measures Study ("CMS") remediation program approved United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") completed remediation 1994. At Lackawanna, Bethlehem conducting RFI. At Burns Harbor, Bethlehem conducting RFI accordance EPA approved work plan require years complete. At Sparrows Point, Bethlehem, EPA Maryland Department Environment agreed phased RFI part comprehensive multimedia pollution prevention agreement entered U. S. District Court Maryland October 8, 1997. The potential costs remediation activities, any, Lackawanna, Burns Harbor Sparrows Point timeframe implementation activities estimated RFIs, possibly CMSs, completed approved. At plant Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem conducting remedial investigations pursuant Pennsylvania Land Recycling ("Brownfields") Program conjunction comprehensive redevelopment plans. These investigations performed input oversight Pennsylvania Department Environmental Protection EPA Region corrective action staff ensure actions acceptable state federal regulatory authorities. Bethlehem operations acquired part Lukens merger 1998 subject RCRA Corrective Action Program and, therefore, remediation facilities addressed ongoing business. Bethlehem residual liability remediation historic Lukens facilities sold shut merger, liabilities anticipated material. For example, electric arc furnace flue dust disposal site Coatesville, Pennsylvania, facility discussed Lukens 1997 Form 10-K continuing investigated Bethlehem remediation pursuant Pennsylvania Brownfields program. Bethlehem information time suggesting $3 million liability recognized Lukens site appropriate. Under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act 1980, amended ("CERCLA", "Superfund"), EPA impose liability site remediation generators transporters waste, past present owners operators sites waste disposed of, fault legality disposal activities. Bethlehem actively involved 24 sites advised considered potentially responsible party CERCLA State Superfund legislation. Based experience site remediation knowledge extent involvement sites, Bethlehem expects share costs remediation sites material. In 1997 Form 10-K, Lukens discussed CERCLA site (Douglassville) involved. Subsequent discussion, Lukens Bethlehem identified separate de-minimis potentially responsible parties signatories consent decree entered U.S. District Court Eastern District Pennsylvania July 8, 1999. Within 60 days entry consent decree, Bethlehem paid approximately $204,000 behalf Lukens $125,000 behalf Bethlehem full resolution liabilities. 6 <PAGE> Although Bethlehem's future quarterly annual results operations materially affected future costs environmental compliance, Bethlehem believes future costs environmental compliance material adverse effect consolidated financial position competitive position respect integrated domestic steelmakers subject environmental requirements. To extent competitors required undertake equivalent costs, Bethlehem's competitive position adversely affected. Purchased Materials Services Bethlehem purchases $3 billion year raw materials, energy, equipment, goods services commercial sources 40 countries. Bethlehem's profitability affected difficulties obtaining items prices paid them. These difficulties include things labor strikes, political instability natural disasters. Bethlehem made significant progress 1999 Strategic Sourcing initiatives expects progress 2000. See "ITEM 2.

Accounting Policies Principles Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include accounts Bethlehem Steel Corporation majority-owned subsidiaries joint ventures. Cash Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist primarily overnight investments, certificates deposit short-term, highly liquid instruments generally original maturities time acquisition months less. Cash equivalents stated cost accrued interest, approximates market. Inventories - Inventories valued lower cost (principally FIFO) market. Property, Plant Equipment - Property, plant equipment stated cost. Maintenance, repairs renewals materially add property appreciably prolong life charged expense. Gains losses dispositions property, plant equipment recognized income. Interest capitalized significant construction projects totaled $26 million 1999 $7 million 1998 1997. Our property, plant equipment major classification follows: December 31 (Dollars millions) 1999 1998 - ------------------------------------------------------------------- Land (net depletion) $ 39.9 $ 33.2 Buildings 651.0 649.2 Machinery equipment 5,949.8 5,720.7 Accumulated depreciation (4,263.6) (4,119.4) - ------------------------------------------------------------------- 2,377.1 2,283.7 Construction-in-progress 522.6 372.0 Total $ 2,899.7 $ 2,655.7 - ------------------------------------------------------------------- Depreciation - Depreciation based estimated lives asset group. That life 18 years steel producing assets. Steel producing assets, blast furnace linings, depreciated straight-line basis adjusted activity factor. This factor based ratio production shipments current year average production shipments current preceding years operating location. Annual depreciation adjustment activity factor 75% 125% straight-line depreciation. Depreciation adjustment activity factor $10 million straight- line 1999, $1 million straight line 1998 $5 million straight-line 1997. Through December 31, 1999, $5 million accumulated depreciation recorded method recorded straight-line depreciation. The cost blast furnace linings depreciated unit-of- production basis. Amortization - Goodwill, resulting acquisition Lukens, amortized 30-year life straight-line method. Amortization $12 million 1999 $7 million 1998. See Note C, Acquisition Lukens Inc. Asset Impairment - We periodically evaluate carrying property, plant equipment goodwill events circumstances warrant review. Property, plant equipment considered impaired anticipated undiscounted future cash flows logical grouping assets carrying value. In event, <PAGE> recognize loss equal amount carrying exceeds fair market assets (less estimated disposal costs, assets disposed of). See Note B, Estimated (Loss) Gain Exiting Businesses. Foreign Currency, Interest Rate Commodity Price Risk Management - Periodically, enter financial contracts manage risks. We foreign currency exchange contracts manage cost firm purchase commitments capital equipment purchased goods services denominated foreign currency. We interest rate swap agreements fix interest rate floating rate financings. We commodity contracts fix cost portion annual requirements natural gas, zinc metals. Generally, foreign currency commodity contracts periods year. The gains losses contracts reflected cost goods services purchased contracts settled. Net payments receipts interest rate swaps reflected interest expense. Gains losses swaps settled terminated deferred amortized interest expense life related debt. Beginning January 1, 2001, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, Accounting Derivative Instruments Hedging Activities, requires recognize financial derivative contracts assets liabilities balance sheet measure fair value. At December 31, 1999, fair financial derivative contracts asset $9 million (an asset $10 million natural gas metal contracts, net $1 million liability interest rate swaps). Gains losses contracts, extent effective hedges, continue recognized settled. Gains losses interest rate swaps settled terminated longer deferred recognized income immediately. Adoption Statement No. 133 expected material impact operating results financial position. Environmental Expenditures - Environmental expenditures increase life efficiency property, plant equipment, reduce prevent future environmental contamination capitalized. Expenditures relate existing conditions caused past operations significant future economic benefit expensed. Environmental expenses accrued time expenditure probable cost estimated. We discount recorded obligations future remediation expenditures present record recoveries environmental remediation costs insurance carriers parties, any, assets receipt deemed probable. Revenue Recognition - We recognize substantially revenues products shipped customers risks ownership change. Use Estimates - In preparing financial statements, make estimates assumptions affect reported amounts disclosures. See, example, Note D, Taxes; Note F, Commitments Contingent Liabilities; Note G, Postretirement Benefits. In future, actual amounts received paid differ estimates. B. Estimated (Loss) Gain Exiting Businesses In 1998, recorded $35 million ($29 million after-tax, $.23 diluted share) charge connection closing Sparrows Point 160-inch plate mill. This loss included $25 million net book assets $10 million employee benefit related costs ($5 million pensions, $2 million postretirement benefits pensions, $3 million severance benefits). In 1997, sold 37.57 percent interest Iron Ore Company Canada $145 million. This sale resulted gain $135 million ($113 million tax, $.92 diluted share). C. Acquisition Lukens Inc. On May 29, 1998, Bethlehem acquired outstanding capital stock Lukens Inc. The aggregate purchase price $560.6 million comprised cash $327.8 million, issuance 15.1 million shares Bethlehem Common Stock valued $184.8 million, transaction related costs $48.0 million. The acquisition accounted purchase. Accordingly, Lukens' results included Consolidated Financial Statements date acquisition. The fair (in millions) assets acquired liabilities assumed follows: Current assets $ 187.8 Property, plant equipment 265.1 Net assets discontinued stainless distribution businesses 316.0 Deferred tax asset, 70.4 Goodwill 360.0 Current liabilities (110.0) Postretirement benefit liabilities (230.0) Debt (268.5) Other long-term liabilities (30.2) Purchase price, net cash acquired $ 560.6 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Through January 2000, completed planned divestiture stainless distribution businesses acquired Lukens purchase amounts essentially equal $316 million. Since date acquisition, operations accounted discontinued operations incurred operating losses $36 million. The net assets businesses shown separately balance sheet consist primarily property, plant equipment working capital. The unaudited pro forma combined historical results (excluding stainless distribution businesses) Lukens acquired beginning 1997 estimated be: December 31 (Dollars millions, share) 1998 1997 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Sales $4,717.5 $5,147.7 Income Operations 200.1 404.3 Net Income 121.4 286.2 Net Income Per Share: Basic $ .62 $ 1.92 Diluted .62 1.86 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- <PAGE> D.

Our employee benefits temporary difference includes amounts expensed financial statements postretirement pensions, health care life insurance deductible tax return payment funding qualified trusts. The depreciable assets temporary difference represents principally cumulative tax depreciation excess financial statement depreciation. Other temporary differences represent principally expenses accrued financial reporting purposes deductible tax reporting purposes paid. At December 31, 1999, regular tax net operating loss carryforwards $1.4 billion alternative minimum tax loss carryforwards $600 million. A regular net operating loss $65 million expected expire file 1999 federal tax return 2000. Regular federal tax net operating loss carry- <PAGE> forwards $145 million $220 million expire 2000 2001, balance expiring varying amounts 2005 2019, unable amounts related federal income tax returns. Under conditions involving future Bethlehem's ownership, Section 382 Internal Revenue Code substantially reduce limit annual utilization net operating loss carryforwards. FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting Income Taxes, requires record valuation allowance "more portion deferred tax assets realized." It states, "forming conclusion valuation allowance needed difficult negative evidence cumulative losses recent years." The ultimate realization deferred tax asset depends ability generate sufficient taxable income future. Excluding estimated (losses) gains exiting businesses, Bethlehem reported net income past years, undergone substantial restructuring made strategic capital expenditures years. Also, tax planning opportunities affect taxable income including selection depreciation methods lives, sales assets timing contributions pension trust fund. Based current outlook 2000, 2001 beyond, deferred tax asset realized future operating results tax planning opportunities. However, significant net operating loss carryforwards future tax deductions temporary differences make record valuation allowance. Accordingly, provided valuation allowance equal 50% deferred tax asset related operating loss carry-forward temporary differences. We provided valuation allowance postretirement benefits, temporary differences $1,555 million January 1, 1992 (See Note G, Postretirement Benefits) $195 million assumed connection acquisition Lukens (See Note C, Acquisition Lukens Inc.). If tax loss year tax deduction postretirement benefits exceeds financial statement expense, tax law 20-year carryforward loss future taxable income. Because sufficient time realize future tax benefits, valuation allowance deferred tax asset related temporary differences postretirement benefits. If unable generate sufficient taxable income future operating results tax planning opportunities, required reduce net deferred tax asset charge income tax expense (reducing stockholders' equity). On hand, achieve sufficient profitability deferred income tax asset, reduce valuation allowance reduction income tax expense (increasing stockholders' equity).
