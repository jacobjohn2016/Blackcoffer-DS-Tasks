 have negatively impacted, or may in the future negatively impact, our liquidity.
 To meet our commitments and to maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to

 our 2009 aircraft deliveries and have arranged backstop financing which could be

 extraordinary increases in the price of fuel that occurred in 2007 and 2008.
 Furthermore, even though fuel prices have declined significantly from their

 transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future
 availability of jet fuel. If there are additional outbreaks of hostilities or
 other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere, or a reduction in refining
 capacity (due to weather events, for example), or governmental limits on the
 production or sale of jet fuel, there could be a reduction in the supply of jet
 fuel and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel. Major reductions in the

 December 31, 2008 American had a secured bank credit facility (the Credit
 Facility) consisting of a fully drawn $255&#160;million revolving credit
 facility with a final maturity on June&#160;17, 2009, and a fully drawn
 $436&#160;million term loan facility with a final maturity on December&#160;17,
 2010. The Credit Facility contains a liquidity covenant and a covenant that
 requires AMR to maintain certain minimum ratios of cash flow to fixed charges
 (the EBITDAR covenant). We were in compliance with the liquidity covenant as of
 December 31, 2008. In May&#160;2008, we entered into an amendment to the Credit
 Facility which waived compliance with the EBITDAR covenant for periods ending on
 any date from and including June&#160;30, 2008 and through March&#160;31, 2009,
 and which reduced the minimum ratios AMR is required to satisfy thereafter.
 Given fuel prices that have been very high by historical standards and the
 volatility of fuel prices and revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and
 about other sources of funding, and other factors, it is difficult to assess
 whether we will be able to continue to comply with these covenants, and there
 are no assurances that we will be able to do so. Failure to comply with these
 covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facility which &#8212; if we did
 not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default &#8212; could
 result in a default under a significant amount of our other debt and lease
 obligations, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on us.</font></div>

 decisions are significantly affected by competition from other airlines. Fare
 discounting by competitors historically has had a negative effect on our
 financial results because we must generally match competitors&#8217; fares, since
 failing to match would result in even less revenue. We have faced increased
 competition from carriers with simplified fare structures, which are generally
 preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may
 not be offset by increases in passenger traffic, reduction in cost or changes in
 the mix of traffic that would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our
 competitors that increase or reduce overall industry capacity, or capacity
 dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, market or route, can have
 a material impact on related fare levels.

 have been numerous mergers and acquisitions within the airline industry and

 became the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world in terms of

 industry consolidation or changes in airline alliances could substantially alter
 the competitive landscape and result in changes in our corporate or business

 industry and changes in airline alliances, our strategic position and ways to
 enhance our competitiveness, including the possibilities for our participation
 in merger activity. Consolidation involving other participants in our industry
 could result in the formation of one or more airlines with greater financial
 resources, more extensive networks, and/or lower cost structures than exist
 currently, which could have a material adverse effect on us. For similar
 reasons, changes in airline alliances could also adversely affect our
 competitive position.</font><br>

 for commercial cooperation on flights between North America and most countries

 other areas. Along with these carriers and certain other carriers, we have
 applied to the U.S. Department of Transportation for antitrust immunity for this

 must be obtained may impose requirements or limitations as a condition of

 in our pricing power. Our reduced pricing power is the product of several
 factors including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers
 (particularly business travelers); pricing transparency resulting from the use
 of the Internet; greater competition from low-cost carriers and from carriers
 that have recently reorganized under the protection of Chapter&#160;11; other
 carriers being well hedged against rising fuel costs and able to better absorb
 high jet fuel prices; and fare simplification efforts by certain carriers. We

 existed the potential for unlocking additional stockholder value with respect to
 one or more of these strategic assets through some type of separation
 transaction. As a result of this review, AMR announced in late 2007 that it
 planned to divest AMR Eagle; however, in mid-2008 AMR announced that, given the
 then-current industry environment, AMR had decided to place that planned
 divestiture on hold until industry conditions are more favorable and stable.
 Also pursuant to the review, AMR sold American Beacon Advisors to a third party

 additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been
 enacted from time to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline
 operations, reduced the demand for air travel or restricted the way we can
 conduct our business. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act,
 which became law in 2001, mandated the federalization of certain airport
 security procedures and resulted in the imposition of additional security
 requirements on airlines. In addition, many aspects of our operations are
 subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and concerns about
 climate change, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional
 regulation. For example, the EU has approved a proposal that will put a cap on
 carbon dioxide emissions for all flights into and out of the EU effective in
 2012. Laws or regulations similar to those described above or other U.S. or

 airlines carry about 740 million passengers a year and are forecasted to
 accommodate a billion passengers annually by 2015. Air-traffic controllers rely
 on outdated technologies that routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines
 to fly inefficient, indirect routes. We support a common-sense approach to ATC
 modernization that would allocate cost to all ATC system users in proportion to
 the services they consume. The reauthorization by the U.S. Congress of

 the ATC system, is pending, but it is uncertain when any such legislation will
