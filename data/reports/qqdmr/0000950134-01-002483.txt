 
 MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS
 
 The risk inherent in the Company's market risk sensitive instruments and
 positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
 fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The
 sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse
 changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional
 actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes. Actual
 results may differ. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for
 accounting policies and additional information. In addition, the following
 analyses exclude any impact of the proposed transactions discussed on page 23.
 
 AIRCRAFT FUEL The Company's earnings are affected by changes in the price and
 availability of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over
 price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage
 facilities to support its flight operations. The Company also manages the price
 risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing swap and option contracts. Market risk is
 estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the December 31, 2000 and
 1999 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2001 fuel usage, such an
 increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately
 $194 million in 2001, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31,
 2000. Comparatively, based on projected 2000 fuel usage, such an increase would
 have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $131
 million in 2000, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 1999.
 The change in market risk is due primarily to the increase in fuel prices. As of
 December 31, 2000, the Company had hedged approximately 40 percent of its 2001
 fuel requirements, approximately 15 percent of its 2002 fuel requirements, and
 approximately seven percent of its 2003 fuel requirements, compared to
 approximately 48 percent of its 2000 fuel requirements and 10 percent of its
 2001 fuel requirements hedged at December 31, 1999.
 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate
 fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating
 revenues and expenses. The Company's largest exposure comes from the Canadian
 dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, Euro and various Latin and South American
 currencies. The Company uses options to hedge a portion of its anticipated
 foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. The result of a uniform 10 percent
 strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2000 and 1999
 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign
 currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of
 approximately $33 million and $39 million for the years ending December 31, 2001
 and 2000, respectively, net of hedge instruments outstanding at December 31,
 2000 and 1999, due to the Company's foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its
 foreign-denominated expenses. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon
 projected 2001 and 2000 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of
 December 31, 2000 and 1999.
 
 INTEREST The Company's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates
 due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and
 short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
 instruments. The Company has variable-rate debt instruments representing
 approximately 29 percent and 21 percent of its total long-term debt,
 respectively, at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and interest rate swaps on notional
 amounts of approximately $158 million and $696 million, respectively, at
 December 31, 2000 and 1999. During 2000, the Company terminated interest rate
 swap agreements on notional amounts of approximately $425 million. The cost of
 terminating these interest rate swap agreements was not material. If interest
 rates average 10 percent more in 2001 than they did at December 31, 2000, the
 Company's interest expense would increase by approximately $11 million and
 interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by
 approximately $15 million. In comparison, at December 31, 1999, the Company
 estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2000 than they did
 at December 31, 1999, the Company's interest expense would have increased by
 approximately $10 million and interest income from cash and short-term
 investments would have increased by approximately $11 million. These amounts are
 determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the
 Company's variable-rate long-term debt, interest rate swap agreements, and cash
 and short-term investment balances at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

        Market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential
 increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
 interest rates, and amounts to approximately $148 million and $156 million as of
 December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fair values of the Company's
 long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future
 cash flows based on the Company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types
 of borrowing arrangements.
 
 INVESTMENTS The Company is subject to market risk related to its ownership of
 approximately 1.2 million depository certificates convertible, subject to
 certain restrictions, into the common stock of Equant, as of December 31, 2000
 and 1999. The estimated fair value of these depository certificates was
 approximately $32 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively, based upon the market value of Equant common stock.
 
        In addition, the Company holds investments in certain other entities
 which are subject to market risk. However, the impact of such market risk on
 earnings is not significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and
 the geographically diverse nature of these holdings.
