 
 MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS
 
        The risk inherent in the Company's market risk sensitive instruments and
 positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
 fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The
 sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse
 changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional
 actions management may take to mitigate the Company's exposure to such changes.
 Actual results may differ. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements
 for accounting policies and additional information.
 
 AIRCRAFT FUEL The Company's earnings are affected by changes in the price and
 availability of aircraft fuel. In order to provide a measure of control over
 price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage
 facilities to support its flight operations. The Company also manages the price
 risk of fuel costs primarily by utilizing jet fuel, heating oil, and crude swap
 and option contracts. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent
 increase in the December 31, 2001 and 2000 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on
 projected 2002 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an increase to
 aircraft fuel expense of approximately $169 million in 2002, net of fuel hedge
 instruments outstanding at December 31, 2001, and assumes the Company's fuel
 hedging program remains effective under Statement of Financial Accounting
 Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
 Activities". Comparatively, based on projected 2001 fuel usage, such an increase
 would have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately
 $194 million in 2001, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31,
 2000. The change in market risk is due primarily to the decrease in fuel prices.
 As of December 31, 2001, the Company had hedged approximately 40 percent of its
 estimated 2002 fuel requirements, approximately 21 percent of its estimated 2003
 fuel requirements, and approximately five percent of its estimated 2004 fuel
 requirements, compared to approximately 40 percent of its estimated 2001 fuel
 requirements, 15 percent of its estimated 2002 fuel requirements, and
 approximately seven percent of its estimated 2003 fuel requirements hedged at
 December 31, 2000.
 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate
 fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating
 revenues and expenses. The Company's largest exposure comes from the British
 pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American
 currencies. The Company uses options to hedge a portion of its anticipated
 foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. The result of a uniform 10 percent
 strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2001 and 2000
 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign
 currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of
 approximately $40 million and $33 million for the years ending December 31, 2002
 and 2001, respectively, net of hedge instruments outstanding at December 31,
 2001 and 2000, due to the Company's foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its
 foreign-denominated expenses. This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon
 projected 2002 and 2001 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of
 December 31, 2001 and 2000.
 
 INTEREST The Company's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates
 due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and
 short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
 instruments. The Company has variable-rate debt instruments representing
 approximately 35 percent and 29 percent of its total long-term debt at December
 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and interest rate swaps on notional amounts of
 approximately $148 million and $158 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001
 and 2000. If interest rates average 10 percent more in 2002 than they did at
 December 31, 2001, the Company's interest expense would increase by
 approximately $10 million and interest income from cash and short-term
 investments would increase by approximately $16 million. In comparison, at
 December 31, 2000, the Company estimated that if interest rates averaged 10
 percent more in 2001 than they did at December 31, 2000, the Company's interest
 expense would have increased by approximately $11 million and interest income
 from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately $15
 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the
 hypothetical interest rates on the Company's variable-rate long-term debt,
 interest rate swap agreements, and cash and short-term investment balances at
 December 31, 2001 and 2000.

        Market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential
 increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
 interest rates, and amounts to approximately $318 million and $148 million as of
 December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The change in market risk is due
 primarily to the increase in the Company's fixed-rate long-term debt during
 2001. The fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated using
 quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Company's
 incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
 
        In addition, the Company holds investments in certain other entities
 which are subject to market risk. However, the impact of such market risk on
 earnings is not significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and
 the geographically diverse nature of these holdings.
