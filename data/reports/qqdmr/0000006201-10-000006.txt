 on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the Company&#8217;s exposure to such changes.&#160;&#160;Therefore, actual results may differ.&#160;&#160;The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

 facilities to support its flight operations.&#160;&#160;The Company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily by using jet fuel and heating oil hedging contracts.&#160;&#160;Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the December 31, 2009 and 2008 cost per gallon of fuel.&#160;&#160;Based on projected 2010 fuel usage, such an increase would result in an increase to Aircraft fuel expense of approximately $499 million in 2010, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments
 outstanding at December 31, 2009, and assumes the Company&#8217;s fuel hedging program remains effective. Such an increase would have resulted in an increase to projected Aircraft fuel expense of approximately $399 million in 2009, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2008.&#160;&#160;As of January 2010, the Company had cash flow hedges, with collars and options, covering approximately 24 percent of its estimated 2010 fuel requirements.&#160;&#160;Comparatively, as of
 December 31, 2008, the Company had hedged, with collars and options, approximately 35 percent of its estimated 2009 fuel requirements.&#160;&#160;The consumption hedged for 2010 by cash flow hedges is capped at an average price of approximately $2.48 per gallon of jet fuel, and the Company&#8217;s collars have an average floor price of approximately $1.80 per gallon of jet fuel (both the capped and floor price exclude taxes and transportation costs).&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s collars represent approximately
 22 percent of its estimated 2010 fuel requirements.&#160;&#160;A deterioration of the Company&#8217;s financial position could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s ability to hedge fuel in the future.</font></div>

 cash flows of the hedged items.&#160;&#160;In doing so, the Company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel (e.g., NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of jet fuel.&#160;&#160;The Company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges&#8217; market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges.&#160;&#160;The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be &#8220;highly effective&#8221; if the R-squared is greater
 than 80 percent and the dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent.&#160;&#160;The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging relationship.</font></div>

 Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and various Latin American currencies. The Company does not currently have a foreign currency hedge program related to its foreign currency-denominated ticket sales.&#160;&#160;A uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2009 and 2008 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $136 million and $146 million for the years ending
 December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to the Company&#8217;s foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its foreign-denominated expenses.&#160;&#160;This sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2010 and 2009 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.</font></div>

 does not expect any significant ongoing impact of the currency devaluation on its operations in Venezuela, but there can be no assurances to that effect.</font></div>

 largest exposure with respect to variable rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Company had variable rate debt instruments representing approximately 23 percent and 28 percent of its total long-term debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.&#160;&#160;If the Company&#8217;s interest rates average 10 percent more in 2010 than they did at December 31, 2009, the Company&#8217;s interest expense would increase by approximately $8 million and interest income from cash
 and short-term investments would increase by approximately $1 million.&#160;&#160;In comparison, at December 31, 2008, the Company estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2009 than they did at December 31, 2008, the Company&#8217;s interest expense would have increased by approximately $13 million and interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by approximately $7 million.&#160;&#160;These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest
