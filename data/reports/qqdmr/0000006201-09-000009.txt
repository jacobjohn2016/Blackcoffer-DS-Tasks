 inherent in the Company&#8217;s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the
 potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign

 changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional

 Fuel</font>&#160;&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s earnings are affected by changes in
 the price and availability of aircraft fuel.&#160;&#160;In order to provide a
 measure of control over price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and
 maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight
 operations.&#160;&#160;The Company also manages the price risk of fuel costs
 primarily by using jet fuel and heating oil hedging contracts.&#160;&#160;Market
 risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the December 31, 2008
 and 2007 cost per gallon of fuel.&#160;&#160;Based on projected 2009 fuel usage,
 such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of
 approximately $399 million in 2009, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel
 hedge instruments outstanding at December 31, 2008, and assumes the Company&#8217;s
 fuel hedging program remains effective under Statement of Financial Accounting
 Standards No. 133, &#8220;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
 Activities&#8221;.&#160;&#160;Comparatively, based on projected 2008 fuel usage, such
 an increase would have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of
 approximately $649 million in 2008, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge
 instruments outstanding at December 31, 2007.&#160;&#160;The change in market
 risk is primarily due to the decrease in fuel prices.&#160;&#160;As of January
 2009, the Company had cash flow hedges, with collars and options, covering
 approximately 35 percent of its estimated 2009 fuel
 requirements.&#160;&#160;Comparatively, as of December 31, 2007 the Company had
 hedged, with collars and options, approximately 24 percent of its estimated 2008
 fuel requirements.&#160;&#160;The consumption hedged for 2009 by cash flow
 hedges is capped at an average price of approximately $2.59 per gallon of jet
 fuel, and the Company&#8217;s collars have an average floor price of approximately
 $1.94 per gallon of jet fuel (both the capped and floor price exclude taxes and
 transportation costs).&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s collars represent approximately
 32 percent of its estimated 2009 fuel requirements.&#160;&#160;A deterioration
 of the Company&#8217;s financial position could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s
 ability to hedge fuel in the future.</font></div>

 is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or
 other crude oil related commodities.&#160;&#160;As required by Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, &#8220;Accounting for Derivative Instruments
 and Hedging Activity&#8221; (SFAS 133), the Company assesses, both at the inception of
 each hedge and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
 its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
 flows of the hedged items.&#160;&#160;In doing so, the Company uses a regression
 model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities
 used to hedge jet fuel (e.g. NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of
 jet fuel.&#160;&#160;The Company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the
 hedges&#8217; market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel
 hedges.&#160;&#160;The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be &#8220;highly
 effective&#8221; if the R-squared is greater than 80 percent and the dollar offset
 correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent.&#160;&#160;The Company
 discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative
 is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to
 discontinue the hedging relationship.</font></div>

 Company&#8217;s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the
 impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and short-term

 instruments.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s largest exposure with respect to
 variable-rate debt comes from changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate
 (LIBOR). The Company had variable-rate debt instruments representing
 approximately 28 percent and 22 percent of its total long-term debt at December
 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.&#160;&#160;If the Company&#8217;s interest rates
 average 10 percent more in 2009 than they did at December 31, 2008, the
 Company&#8217;s interest expense would increase by approximately $13 million and
 interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by
 approximately $7 million.&#160;&#160;In comparison, at December 31, 2007, the
 Company estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2008 than
 they did at December 31, 2007, the Company&#8217;s interest expense would have
 increased by approximately $14 million and interest income from cash and
