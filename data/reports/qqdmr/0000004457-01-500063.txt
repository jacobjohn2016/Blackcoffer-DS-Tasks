 
 Interest Rate Risk
      In the normal course of business, AMERCO is exposed to fluctuations in
 interest rates.  AMERCO manages such exposure by the use of a variety of
 derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent.  AMERCO does not enter
 into leveraged financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments
 for trading purposes.  The exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
 relates primarily to debt obligations.  AMERCO's objective is to mitigate the
 impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.  AMERCO uses
 interest rate swap agreements to provide for matching the gain or loss
 recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the
 fair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or the
 earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.  See Note 5 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  A fluctuation of the interest rate
 by 100 basis points would change AMERCO's interest expense by $1.0 million.
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
      AMERCO's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign
 currency exchange rates.  Approximately 2.0% of AMERCO's revenue is generated in
 Canada.  The result of a uniform 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar
 relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material.  AMERCO does not
 typically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered
 material.
