 
 There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided
 in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the
 Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000,
 except as discussed below.
 
      Based on projected fuel usage for the next twelve months, including the
 Company's estimated fuel consumption for TWA based upon TWA's actual average
 consumption for the twelve months ended September 30, 2000, a hypothetical 10
 percent increase in the March 31, 2001 cost per gallon of fuel would result in
 an increase to the Company's aircraft fuel expense of approximately $204 million
 for the next twelve months, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at March
 31, 2001. The change in market risk from December 31, 2000 is due primarily to
 the estimated fuel consumption of TWA, partially offset by a decrease in fuel
 prices. As of March 31, 2001, the Company, including the estimated fuel
 consumption of TWA, has hedged approximately 40 percent of its remaining 2001
 fuel requirements, 22 percent of its 2002 fuel requirements, and approximately
 11 percent of its 2003 fuel requirements.
