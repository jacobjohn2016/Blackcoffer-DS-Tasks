         OF OPERATIONS
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2002 AND 2001
 
 SUMMARY AMR Corporation's (AMR or the Company) LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF
 ACCOUNTING CHANGE during the first quarter of 2002 was $575 million, or $3.71
 per share, as compared to a net loss of $43 million, or $0.28 per share for the
 same period in 2001. AMR's OPERATING LOSS of $729 million increased $725 million
 compared to the same period in 2001. The Company's 2002 results continue to be
 adversely impacted by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In addition, on
 April 9, 2001, American Airlines, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR)
 purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
 Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA). Accordingly, the operating results of TWA are
 included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the
 three-month period ended March 31, 2002 but not for the three-month period ended
 March 31, 2001. All references to American Airlines, Inc. include TWA
 (collectively, American). In addition, effective January 1, 2002, the Company
 recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $988 million (net of tax), reflected as
 a cumulative effect of accounting change, to write-off all of AMR's goodwill.
 
 Although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity
 since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's first quarter 2002
 revenues were down significantly year-over-year. In addition to the residual
 effects of September 11, the Company's revenues continue to be negatively
 impacted by the economic slowdown -- seen largely in business travel declines --
 and an increase in fare sale activity. In total, the Company's REVENUES
 decreased $624 million, or 13.1 percent, in the first quarter of 2002 from the
 same period last year. American's PASSENGER REVENUES decreased by 11.5 percent,
 or $451 million in the first three months of 2002 from the same period in 2001.
 American's domestic revenue per available seat mile (RASM) decreased 15.4
 percent, to 8.7 cents, on a capacity increase of 9.4 percent, to 29.3 billion
 available seat miles (ASMs). International RASM decreased to 8.66 cents, or 10.6
 percent, on a capacity decrease of 11.4 percent. The decrease in international
 RASM was due to a 14.1 percent decrease and 11.9 percent decrease in European
 and Latin American RASM, respectively, slightly offset by a 9 percent increase
 in Pacific RASM. The decrease in international capacity was driven by a 39.5
 percent, 13.9 percent and 4 percent reduction in Pacific, European and Latin
 American ASMs, respectively.
 
 AMR Eagle's PASSENGER REVENUES decreased 13.8 percent, or $49 million. AMR
 Eagle's traffic increased 6.9 percent while capacity decreased 1.3 percent, to
 approximately 1.6 billion ASMs. As with American, the decrease in AMR Eagle's
 revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the September 11, 2001
 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown.
 
 Cargo REVENUES decreased $42 million, or 23.9 percent, for the same reasons as
 noted above.
 
 OTHER REVENUES decreased 27.8 percent, or $82 million, due primarily to
 decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for other
 airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service
 charges.
 
 The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES increased 2.1 percent, or $101 million.
 American's cost per ASM increased 0.4 percent to 11.30 cents. WAGES, SALARIES
 AND BENEFITS increased 19.1 percent, or $334 million, primarily due to
 contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the Company's
 labor contracts. In addition, the Company experienced increases in its pension
 and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care
 and prescription drug costs. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense decreased 25.5 percent, or
 $180 million, due primarily to a 23.3 percent decrease in the Company's average
 price per gallon of fuel. OTHER RENTALS AND LANDING FEES increased 12.5 percent,
 or $32 million, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees across American's
 system. AIRCRAFT RENTALS increased $78 million, or 52.7 percent, due primarily
 to the addition of TWA aircraft. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS decreased 28.1 percent,
 or $63 million, due primarily to an 11.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues
 and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. OTHER OPERATING
 EXPENSES decreased 11 percent, or $100 million, due primarily to decreases in
 contract maintenance work that American performs for other airlines, and
 decreases in travel and incidental costs, advertising and promotion costs, and
 credit card fees, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security
 costs.

 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), historically a net expense, increased $81 million due to
 the following: INTEREST INCOME decreased 55 percent, or $22 million, due
 primarily to decreases in interest rates. INTEREST EXPENSE increased $47
 million, or 39.5 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the Company's
 long-term debt. INTEREST CAPITALIZED decreased $19 million, or 46.3 percent, due
 primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment.
 MISCELLANEOUS-NET decreased 46.7 percent, or $7 million, due to the write-down
 of certain investments held by the Company during the first quarter of 2001.
 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2002 was impacted by
 a $27 million charge resulting from a provision in Congress' economic stimulus
 package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs).
 This change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years,
 rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the Company to more
 quickly recover its NOLs. The extended NOL carryback did, however, result in the
 displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. These credits are now
 expected to expire before being utilized by the Company, resulting in this
 charge.

 McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, 19 operating leased Boeing 717-200s, nine owned
 McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10s, four operating leased McDonnell Douglas MD-80s,
 three owned McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, two owned McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s, and
 four owned, six capital leased and two operating leased Saab 340Bs.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES in the three-month period ended March 31,
 2002 was $406 million, an increase of $425 million over the same period in 2001,
 due primarily to an increase in the Company's net loss. Capital expenditures for
 the first three months of 2002 were $619 million, and included the acquisition
 of six Boeing 757-200s, two Boeing 777-200ERs, seven Embraer 140s and two
 Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft. These capital expenditures were financed primarily
 through secured mortgage and debt agreements.
 
 As of March 31, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire the following
 aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 12 Boeing 777-200ERs, nine Boeing 767-300ERs, one
 Boeing 757-200, 117 Embraer regional jets and 22 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries
 of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through 2008. Payments for these
 aircraft are expected to be approximately $825 million during the remainder of
 2002, $1.7 billion in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of
 approximately $1.9 billion in 2005 through 2008.
 
 OTHER INFORMATION
 
 In addition to the Company's approximately $2.3 billion in cash and short-term
 investments as of March 31, 2002, the Company has available a variety of future
 financing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) the receipt of the
 remainder of the U.S. Government grant authorized by the Air Transportation
 Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act), which is estimated to be in
 excess of $100 million, (ii) additional secured aircraft debt, (iii) the
 availability of the Company's $1 billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leaseback
 transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, (v) the
 recovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision in the
 recently passed economic stimulus package regarding NOL carrybacks (in April
 2002, the Company received approximately $393 million related to the utilization
 of its remaining 2001 NOL), (vi) tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities,
 (vii) securitization of future operating receipts, (viii) unsecured borrowings,
 and (ix) borrowings backed by federal loan guarantees as provided under the Act.
 No assurance can be given that any of these financing sources will be available
 on terms acceptable to the Company. However, the Company believes it will meet
 its current financing needs.

 As a result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
 significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to
 commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or
 passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events
 (war-risk coverage). At the same time, they significantly increased the premiums
 for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant to
 authority granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial
 war-risk insurance until May 19, 2002 with a third party liability policy to
 cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable 60-day
 periods. In the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount of
 insurance coverage available or the Government fails to renew war-risk
 insurance, the Company's operations and/or financial position, results of
 operations or cash flows would be adversely impacted.
 
 As discussed in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, a provision in the current Allied
 Pilots Association contract further limits the number of ASMs and block hours
 flown by American's regional carrier partners when American pilots are on
 furlough. As AMR Eagle continues to accept previously ordered regional jets,
 this will cause the ASM cap to be reached sometime in the first half of 2002,
 necessitating actions to comply with that cap. American is working with its
 regional partners to ensure that it is in compliance with this provision.
 Actions currently being taken and considered by AMR Eagle to reduce its capacity
 are discussed in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K. In addition, American is removing
 its code from flights of the American Connection carriers, which are independent
 carriers that provide feed to American's St. Louis hub. American believes that
 the combination of all these actions will enable it to comply with the ASM cap
 through 2002 and for sometime beyond.
 
 OUTLOOK
 
 Capacity for American is expected to be down approximately 11 percent in the
 second quarter of 2002 compared to last year's second quarter levels. AMR
 Eagle's second quarter capacity will be down about three percent from last
 year's levels. For the second quarter of 2002, the Company expects traffic to be
 lower by approximately 11 percent as compared to last year's second quarter
 levels. Pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the Company will
 continue to see higher wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs
 and insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. Although the Company
 expects to see an increase in fuel prices as compared to the first quarter of
 2002, fuel prices are expected to remain lower in the second quarter of 2002 as
 compared to last year's second quarter prices. Further, the Company expects to
 see a benefit in commission expense due to the domestic base commission changes
 implemented in March 2002. In total however, American's unit costs for the
 second quarter of 2002 are expected to be two to three percent higher than last
 year's second quarter. Given this higher unit cost, coupled with the revenue
 pressures seen in the first quarter and expected to continue into the second
 quarter, the Company expects to incur a loss in the second quarter (although the
 Company does not expect this loss to be of the same magnitude as the Company's
 first quarter loss), and will likely incur a loss for 2002.
