 General
       Information on fiscal year and industry segments is incorporated by
 reference to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes
 1, 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".  The notes
 discuss the principles of consolidation, summarized consolidated
 financial information and industry segment and geographic area data,
 respectively.  In consolidation, all intersegment premiums are eliminated
 and the benefits, losses and expenses are retained by the insurance
 companies.
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
       Net cash provided by operating activities was $237.7 million,
 $159.5 million and $180.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  Details by material segment follows:
 
   Moving and Storage Operations
       Cash provided by operating activities was $147.5 million, $128.5
 million and $109.8 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The increase from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 is
 partially due to an increase in net income.  The increase from fiscal
 year 1998 to fiscal year 1999 is also partially due to increased net
 income.
 
   Real Estate Operations
       Cash provided by operating activities was $24.8 million,
 $38.0 million and $92.5 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year 2000, is due to a decrease in
 the intercompany payable.  In fiscal year 1999, proceeds received from
 the sale of real estate was used to pay down the intercompany payable.
 
   Property and Casualty
       Cash provided (used) by operating activities was $(11.1) million,
 $(21.7) million and $23.8 million for the years ended December 31, 1999,
 1998 and 1997, respectively.  The 1999 to 1998 change resulted mainly
 from the increased funds withheld liability, decreased paid losses
 recoverable and a smaller decrease in loss and loss adjustment expense
 reserves.  This was offset by increased premiums and agent's balances
 and the intercompany receivable due from affiliates.  The 1998 to 1997
 change resulted mainly from an increase in paid losses recoverable and
 the change in loss and loss expense reserves partially offset by increased
 net income and decreased accounts receivable.
 
       Republic's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment
 portfolio were $6.0 million, $6.1 million and $16.3 million at December
 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  This balance reflects funds in
 transition from maturity proceeds to long-term investments.  This level
 of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet
 periodic needs.  Capital and operating budgets allow Republic to schedule
 cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds.

   Life Insurance
       Cash provided by operating activities was $22.2 million, $34.6
 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
 1997, respectively.  The decrease in cash flows from operating activities
 in 1999 relates to paid loss experience.  The increase in cash flows from
 operating activities in 1998 relates to the increased premium production
 in the credit insurance and Medicare supplement areas.
 
       Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from
 interest-sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of
 cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching
 the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of
 insurance being written is an important consideration.  Benefit and claim
 statistics are continually monitored to provide projections of future
 cash requirements.
 
       In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities,
 a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-
 term portfolio.  Short-term investments aggregated $30.7 million, $63.4
 million and $13.4 million at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.  Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity
 will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs.
 
 Consolidated Group
       To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain a large
 inventory of fixed asset rental items.  At March 31, 2000, net property,
 plant and equipment represented approximately 66.6% of total assets from
 non-insurance operations and approximately 44.2% of consolidated assets.
 In fiscal year 2000, gross capital expenditures for property, plant and
 equipment were $417.6 million, as compared to $298.5 million and
 $392.3 million in fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively.  These
 expenditures primarily reflect the replacement of certain rental trucks and
 trailers.  The capital needs required to fund these acquisitions were funded
 with internally generated funds from operations and lease financings.
 
       During each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2001, 2002 and
 2003, U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average
 approximately $325 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.
 This level of capital expenditures, combined with a potential range of
 $30-$115 million in annual long-term debt maturities, are expected to
 create annual average funding needs of approximately $355-$440 million.
 Management estimates that U-Haul will fund 100% of these requirements
 with leases and internally generated funds, including proceeds from the
 disposition of older trucks and other asset sales.
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
       U-Haul's stockholder's equity was $435.4 million, $384.7 million
 and $342.9 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to earnings.  The increase in fiscal
 year 1999 was due to earnings and to the sale of property to a related party
 recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.
 The increase in fiscal year 1998 was due to increased earnings.
 
 Real Estate Operations
       Real Estate stockholder's equity was $95.6 million, $79.5 million
 and $45.5 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to earnings. The increase in fiscal
 year 1999 was due to earnings and to the sale of property to a related
 party recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders'
 Equity.  The increase in fiscal year 1998 was due to increased earnings.
 <PAGE> 15
 Property and Casualty
       Republic maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio,
 primarily in bonds at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-
 income securities consisting of investment grade securities.  The
 maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet
 future cash needs.  Current liquidity remains strong, with current
 invested assets equal to 92.9% of total liabilities.
 
       The liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon
 both Republic's historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment
 expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid
 to losses paid.  Unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted.
 
       Republic's stockholder's equity was $208.5 million, $211.4 million
 and $195.4 million at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
 Republic considers current stockholder's equity to be adequate to support
 future growth and absorb unforeseen risk events.  Republic does not use
 debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no exposure
 to capital market conditions.
 
 Life Insurance
       Oxford's stockholder's equity was $88.1 million, $93.6 million and
 $85.8 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Oxford did not pay
 dividends to its parent during 1999, 1998 or 1997.
 
       Applicable laws and regulations of the State of Arizona require
 Republic and Oxford to maintain minimum capital determined in accordance
 with statutory accounting practices.  Such amount is $1.0 million and
 $0.4 million, for Republic and Oxford, respectively.  In addition, the amount
 of dividends that can be paid to stockholders by insurance companies domiciled
 in the State of Arizona is limited.  Any dividend in excess of the limit
 requires prior regulatory approval.  Statutory surplus which can be distributed
 as dividends without regulatory approval at December 31, 1999 is $16.1 million
 and $1.4 million for Republic and Oxford, respectively at December 31, 1999.
 These restrictions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
 the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.  Oxford issued a
 surplus note to AMERCO on December 31, 1998 for $10.0 million.
 Approval by the Arizona Department of Insurance is required prior to
 payment of principal and interest.
 
 Credit Agreements
       AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured medium-
 term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.
 To finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, U-Haul routinely enters into
 sale and leaseback transactions.  As of March 31, 2000, AMERCO had
 $1,137.8 million in total notes and loans outstanding and unutilized
 committed lines of credit of approximately $241.0 million.
 
       Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial
 and other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to
 incurring additional indebtedness, issuing mandatory repayment preferred
 stock, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing certain
 additional liens on its properties and assets.  At March 31, 2000, AMERCO
 was in compliance with these covenants.
 
       Reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 Results of Operations - Consolidated
 
 Rental Revenue
       Rental revenue, net of commission expense was $1,150.5 million,
 $1,074.2 million and $1,018.7 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  Details by material segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
       Rental revenue was $1,148.2 million, $1,072.1 million and $1,016.2
 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase
 from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 was primarily due to the growth
 in truck rental revenues which benefited from transactional growth and
 reflects a higher average revenue per transaction.  The increase from
 fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999 also reflects a growth in truck
 rental revenues benefiting from transactional growth reflecting increased
 utilization.
 <PAGE> 16
    Real Estate Operations
       Rental revenue, before intercompany eliminations, were $73.4 million,
 $74.0 million and $69.9 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  Intercompany rental revenue was $71.0 million, $71.9
 million and $67.4 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The decrease from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000
 was $0.6 million.  Rental revenue was consistent between fiscal year 1999 and
 fiscal year 2000.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 reflects the addition
 of new system operating companies.
 
 Net Sales
       Net sales revenues were $188.8 million, $181.3 million and $176.2
 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Revenue
 growth from the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.) and
 propane resulted in the increase for each year.
 
 Premiums
       Premium revenues, after intercompany eliminations, were $262.1
 million, $226.8 million and $164.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  Details by material segment follow:
 
    Property and Casualty
       Premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were $173.8
 million, $145.3 million and $155.9 million for the years ended December
 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  The 1999 premium increase
 resulted from assumed treaty reinsurance which increased to $80.7
 million, $51.2 million and $49.1 million in the years ended December 31,
 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Republic underwrites professional
 reinsurance via broker markets and premiums in this area increased due to
 the agricultural reinsurance business.  Direct multiple peril and general agency
 premium increased to $25.0 million and $17.8 million in 1999 compared to
 $21.0 million and $6.5 million in 1998, and $16.5 million and $5.8 million
 in 1997, respectively.  This increase was reduced by rental industry earnings,
 which decreased to $50.3 million in 1999 from $66.6 million in 1998 and
 $84.5 million in 1997, respectively.  This decrease results from the
 restructuring of the U-Haul Business Auto General Liability policy.
 The deductible was changed at April 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to a 95%
 deductible.  This reduced premium by $19.6 million in 1999 as compared to 1998.
 This resulted in a savings of $0.6 million in premium taxes for policy year
 1999.
 
    Life Insurance
       Premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were $96.4
 million, $94.5 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31,
 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  During 1999, Oxford realized premium
 increases from 1998 and 1997 in the areas of Medicare supplement, credit
 life and disability, and single premium whole life insurance products.
 Oxford increased Medicare supplement premium through the reinsurance of a
 block of policies and by adding direct premium from the acquisition of
 NAI in 1997, increasing premiums by $6.7 million from 1998 and $35.4
 million from 1997.  Oxford's single premium whole life product accounts
 for an additional $2.9 million of premiums in 1999 over 1998 and $5.5
 million over 1997.  In the area of credit insurance, Oxford increased
 direct writings as well as reduced the amount ceded to outside
 reinsurers.  These factors contributed to a $3.5 million increase in
 premium from 1998 and $28.4 million from 1997.  As expected, premium
 decreases resulted from the termination of non-essential NAI lines,
 fewer annuitizations and from the sale of NAFCIC.  These changes accounted
 for an $11.2 million decrease in premiums in 1999 from 1998 and $2.6 million
 decrease from 1997.
 
 Net Investment and Interest Income
       Net investment and interest income was $82.0 million, $72.4 million
 and $65.7 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Details
 by material segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
       Interest income was $19.5 million, $12.9 million and $13.1 million
 in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase during
 fiscal year 2000 in interest reflects higher average note receivable
 balances.
 
    Real Estate Operations
       Net investment and interest income was $7.0 million, $4.5 million
 and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 increase in fiscal year 2000 is due to interest income received on notes
 receivable.  The increase in fiscal year 1999 was due to the realized gain
 on the sale of property acquired through foreclosure.
 <PAGE> 17
    Property and Casualty
       Net investment income was $33.0 million, $35.9 million and $31.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
 The decrease in 1999 from 1998 is attributable to a decrease in invested
 assets and a lower yield on reinvested funds.  The increase in 1998 over 1997
 resulted from enhanced yield provided by an increased investment in preferred
 stock.
 
    Life Insurance
       Net investment income was $21.3 million, $19.1 million and $17.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.  The increase is due to improved interest rate spreads on
 the retirement savings products.  This improvement was realized as a
 result of better returns on the investment portfolio.
 
 Operating Expenses
       Operating expenses were $918.8 million, $876.6 million and $818.6
 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Details by
 material segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
       Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $931.1
 million, $893.0 million and $857.9 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  The increased expense is due to increased personnel
 cost and other administrative costs.  Increased liability insurance, due
 to transactional growth, continued for fiscal year 2000 from fiscal years
 1999 and 1998.
 
    Real Estate Operations
       Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $4.0
 million, $6.2 million and $7.7 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  Real Estate benefited from a reduction in
 intercompany management fees charged by an affiliated segment company
 during fiscal year 2000 compared to the prior two years.
 
    Property and Casualty
       Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $35.0
 million, $35.6 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31,
 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  The 1998 to 1999 decrease resulted
 from a $2.9 million write off of a commission in 1997 on an
 excess of loss reinsurance contract.  Lease expenses increased to $1.9
 million for 1999 as compared to $1.3 million and $0.3 million for 1998
 and 1997 respectively.  All other underwriting expenses consisted of
 $13.9 million, $15.5 million and $8.2 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.
 
    Life Insurance
       Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $22.8
 million, $19.5 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31,
 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Commissions increased $1.8 million in
 1999 in proportion to the increase in new premium.  Operating expenses,
 still within budgeted expectations, have increased in 1999 due to the
 expansion of business volume.  The increase from 1997 to 1998 is due to the
 commissions and operating expenses related to the acquisition of NAI and
 SML.
 
 Cost of Sales
     Cost of sales was $112.0 million, $106.8 million and $101.7 million
 in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Increased material
 costs and a higher sales volume related to moving support items
 contributed to the fiscal year 2000 increase over fiscal years 1999
 and 1998.
 
 Benefits and Losses
       Benefits and losses were $209.6 million, $176.6 million and $175.6
 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Details by
 material segment follow:
 
    Property and Casualty
       Benefits and losses incurred were $150.5 million, $118.9 million
 and $165.9 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the increase
 in assumed treaty reinsurance claims.  The decrease from 1997 to 1998 is due
 mainly to the reduction in insurance transactions with U-Haul.  This
 corresponds to the decrease in the liabilities for unpaid claims and
 estimated future losses for current and prior policies for those transactions.
 <PAGE> 18
 
 
    Life Insurance
       Benefits incurred were $59.1 million, $57.7 million and $24.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.  This increase is primarily due to Medicare supplement,
 which accounts for $4.4 million of benefit increase from 1998 and
 $27.0 million from 1997.  However, in relation to premium, the percentage
 of Medicare supplement benefits dropped by two percentage points in 1999
 from 1998.  Increases in policyholder reserves for the new whole life product
 increased benefits $2.1 million from 1998 and $3.8 million from 1997.
 Credit insurance benefits increased from 1998 by $0.8 million and from
 1997 by $6.2 million due to increased volume written and retained; loss
 ratios for this line have decreased from 1998 and 1997.  Annuity benefits
 combined with the elimination of non-focused NAI health lines and NAFCIC
 reduced benefits from 1998 by $6.0 million and 1997 by $2.4 million.
 
 Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs
       Amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and the value of
 business acquired (VOBA) was $35.0 million, $31.7 million and $14.2
 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  DAC consists
 of commissions and other policy acquisition costs, which vary with and
 are primarily related to the production of new business.  The prior year
 end commissions and other related expenses are recognized ratably over
 the remainder of the policy year.  The VOBA asset relates to the future
 profits of the credit insurance policies in force when Oxford acquired
 NAI.  Details by material segment follow:
 
    Property and Casualty
       The amortization of DAC for December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
 $13.4 million, $7.4 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The increase
 from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to NAFCIC related DAC expense following
 Republic's purchase of NAFCIC from Oxford in December 1998, which increased
 to $3.8 million from $0.2 million in 1998.  Also contributing was a
 $1.9 million increase in the nonaffiliated agents' expense.  Field underwriting
 expenses increased due to an increase in 1998 written and unearned premiums.
 Excess worker's compensation program increased due to 1998 commission expenses
 relating to a settlement agreement with the previous general agent.  The
 decrease from 1997 to 1998 is due to the assumed reinsurance DAC expense and
 relates to the decrease in unearned premiums.
 
    Life Insurance
       Amortization of DAC and VOBA was $21.6 million, $24.3 million and
 $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.  Oxford defers commissions and other policy acquisition
 costs on single premium business.  These costs are amortized as the
 premium is earned over the term of the policy.  Oxford continues to
 increase its single premium credit business in force, thus increasing
 both the deferred costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent
 amortization.  After Oxford purchased NAI in 1997, Oxford began
 amortizing the VOBA asset recognized at purchase.  In 1999, Oxford did
 not have DAC amortization charges related to NAFCIC that were present in 1998;
 1998 amortization was $3.0 million.  The increase from 1997 was due primarily
 to the credit insurance assumed after the purchase of NAI.
 
 Lease Expense
       Lease expense was $135.7 million, $118.7 million and $89.9 million
 in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Details by material
 segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
       Lease expense was $132.0 million, $118.4 million and $89.9 million
 in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The continued
 increase reflects additional leasing activity.
 
    Real Estate Operations
       Lease expense for real estate operations was $3.0 million, $0.1
 million and $0.1 million for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The increase in fiscal year 2000 over the prior years
 reflects payments under an operating lease facility with a number of financial
 institutions whereby the Company is both lessee and construction agent
 developing storage properties.
 
 <PAGE> 19
 
 Depreciation Expense, net
       Depreciation expense, net was $88.3 million, $73.1 million and $69.7
 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Details by
 material segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
       Depreciation expense, net before intercompany elimination was
 $79.0 million, $61.0 million and $64.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  The increase in fiscal year 2000 reflects an increase
 in depreciation expense on the rental truck fleet.  The decrease in fiscal
 year 1999 reflects an increase in the gains from the disposition of property,
 plant and equipment.  During fiscal year 1999, based on an in-depth market
 analysis, the estimated salvage value and useful lives of certain rental
 equipment was increased.  The effect of the change decreased depreciation
 expense by $11.1 million in fiscal year 1998.  The adjustment reflects
 management's best estimate, based on information currently available, of
 the estimated salvage value and useful lives of this rental equipment.
 
    Real Estate Operations
       Depreciation expense, net before intercompany elimination was
 $9.3 million, $12.0 million and $6.4 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year 2000 reflects an increase
 in gains from the disposition of property, plant and equipment and a decrease
 in depreciation on buildings and non-rental equipment.  The increase in fiscal
 year 1999 reflects a decrease in the gains from the disposition of property,
 plant and equipment as well as the increased depreciation expense relating to
 the addition of new facilities for operating system companies.
 
 Earnings from Operations
       Earnings from operations were $183.9 million, $171.3 million and
 $155.7 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 Details by material segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
       Earnings from operations were $102.4 million, $87.0 million and
 $78.7 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 Increased rental transactions, partially offset by corresponding expenses,
 contributed to the earnings gain for the past two fiscal years.
 
    Real Estate Operations
       Earnings from operations before intercompany elimination were
 $64.0 million, $60.3 million and $58.1 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  A decrease in intercompany management fees charged
 contributed to the earnings increase for fiscal year 2000 compared to the
 prior two fiscal years.
 
    Property and Casualty
       Earnings from operations were $7.9 million, $19.1 million and $0.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
 The 1998 to 1999 decrease resulted mainly from Republic's writing off the
 1995 American Bonding receivable, lower than forecasted premium volume in
 1999 and higher than expected losses on the agricultural business.  The
 1997 to 1998 increase is due to decreased underwriting expenses and
 increased realized gains.
 
    Life Insurance
       Earnings from operations were $14.2 million, $12.2 million and
 $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
 respectively.  The increase over prior years reflects improved investment
 returns, improving loss ratios in the Medicare supplement business and
 better than expected loss experience for the credit business.
 
 Interest Expense
       Interest expense was $81.5 million, $73.7 million and $79.4 million
 in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase can be
 attributed to an increase in the average cost of debt in fiscal year 2000
 over the past two fiscal years.  The average debt level outstanding
 increased in fiscal year 2000 compared to fiscal year 1999, and
 decreased in fiscal year 1999 compared to fiscal year 1998.

 Extraordinary Loss on the Extinguishment of Debt
       During fiscal year 2000, AMERCO extinguished $100.0 million of
 6.65% Bond Backed Asset Trust certificates (BATs) originally due in
 fiscal year 2030 and $50.0 million of 7.05% to 7.10% Medium-Term notes
 originally due in fiscal year 2007.  This resulted in an extraordinary
 loss of $0.3 million, net of tax of $0.2 million ($0.02 per share).
 
       During fiscal year 1998, AMERCO extinguished $76.0 million of
 10.27% interest-bearing notes originally due in fiscal year 1999 through
 fiscal year 2002.  This resulted in an extraordinary loss of $4.0
 million, net of tax of $2.4 million ($0.18 per share).  AMERCO also
 extinguished $255.0 million of 6.43% to 8.13% interest-bearing notes
 originally due in fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2010.  This
 resulted in an extraordinary loss of $9.7 million, net of tax of $5.6
 million ($0.44 per share).
 
 Earnings of the Consolidated Group
       As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $102.7
 million, $97.6 million and $76.3 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  After providing for income taxes, earnings from
 operations were $65.8 million, $62.5 million and $48.7 million in fiscal
 years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Following deductions for an
 extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt, net earnings
 were $65.5 million, $62.5 million and $35.0 million in fiscal years 2000,
 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 
 Quarterly Results
       The table on page 21 presents unaudited quarterly results
 for the eight quarters in the period beginning April 1, 1998 and ending
 March 31, 2000.  AMERCO believes that all necessary adjustments have been
 included in the amounts stated below to present fairly, and in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, the selected quarterly
 information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
 statements incorporated herein by reference.  U-Haul moving and storage
 operations are seasonal and proportionally more of AMERCO's revenues and
 net earnings from its U-Haul moving and storage operations are generated
 in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year (April through
 September).  The operating results for the periods presented are not
 necessarily indicative of results for any future period.

 Year 2000 Disclosure
       In preparation for any potential Year 2000 processing problems,
 AMERCO worked since 1997 to identify any changes necessary to its
 existing computerized business systems to make these systems compliant
 for Year 2000 processing.  AMERCO has spent approximately $2.8 million to
 date in its Year 2000 compliance efforts.  Since January 1, 2000, AMERCO
 has been assessing its information technology systems and has found no
 major Year 2000 processing problems.
 
 
 Stockholder Litigation
       AMERCO has deducted for income tax purposes approximately
 $372.0 million of the payments made to former shareholders in a stockholder
 lawsuit.  While AMERCO believes that such income tax deductions are
 appropriate, there can be no assurance that such deductions ultimately
 will be allowed in full.  Reference is made to Note 15 in Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the stockholder
 litigation.
 
 Other
       New pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
 Board adopted during the year are not material to the consolidated
 financial statements of AMERCO.  Further, pronouncements with future
 effective dates are either not applicable or not material to the
 consolidated financial statements of AMERCO.
