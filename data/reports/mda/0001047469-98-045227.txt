 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
          On June 18, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of assets
 constituting substantially all of the business and operations of First Image
 Management Company("First Image"). For reporting purposes, the acquisition date
 was set as June 1, 1998. The First Image acquisition resulted in incremental
 revenues and EBITDA (defined on page 19) of $37.7 million and $9.7 million,
 respectively, for the period June 1, 1998 to September 30, 1998, and are
 included in the Company's results of operations for the fiscal year ended
 September 30, 1998. See Note 7 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial
 Statements for additional information related to this acquisition.
 
          On May 20, 1996, the Company's Reorganization Plan was confirmed by the
 United States Bankruptcy Court and on June 4, 1996, the Company emerged from
 bankruptcy reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization resulted in a reduction of
 approximately $174 million in principal and accrued interest on the Company's
 debt obligations and in liquidation amount and accrued dividends on its
 preferred stock. As a result of the Reorganization, the recording of the
 restructuring transaction and the implementation of Fresh Start Reporting, the
 Company's results of operations after May 31, 1996 (the cutoff date used for
 financial reporting purposes) are not comparable to results reported in prior
 periods. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
 information on the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and implementation
 of Fresh Start Reporting.
 
          To facilitate a meaningful comparison of the Company's quarterly and
 year-to-date operating performance in fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, the
 following discussion of consolidated results of operations is presented on a
 traditional comparative basis for all periods. Consequently, the information
 presented below for fiscal 1996 does not comply with accounting requirements for
 companies upon emergence from bankruptcy, which requirements call for separate
 reporting for the newly reorganized company and the predecessor company.

 GENERAL
 
          Anacomp reported a net loss of $67.7 million for the year ended
 September 30, 1998 as compared to a net loss of $67.8 million and net income of
 $143.0 million for the years ended September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 The fiscal 1998 net loss includes non-cash amortization of the Company's
 reorganization asset of $75.6 million and an extraordinary loss of $1.1 million
 net of income taxes, on the extinguishment of debt comprised of unamortized debt
 issue costs on the Company's senior secured loan. Included in the fiscal 1997
 net loss is non-cash amortization of the Company's reorganization asset of $75.8
 million and an extraordinary loss of $11.0 million net of income taxes on the
 extinguishment of debt comprised of a 3% call premium and unamortized discount
 on the Company's existing 13% subordinated notes. Net income for fiscal 1996
 includes $25.7 million in non-cash amortization of the Company's reorganization
 asset, a gain of $92.8 million for reorganization items and an extraordinary
 gain resulting from the discharge of indebtedness of $52.4 million.
 
          Pursuant to a 1990 OEM agreement Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak") was
 obligated to purchase an additional 151 XFP 2000 systems by October 1997 or pay
 a cash penalty to the Company. The Company and Kodak negotiated an amendment to
 the OEM agreement, whereby the Company accepted a $3.6 million cash payment from
 Kodak, which is included in the results for fiscal 1997, a commitment to
 purchase an additional 28 XFP 2000 systems and a one-time purchase of spare
 parts. Kodak purchased 16 XFP 2000 systems in fiscal 1997 and 12 in fiscal 1998
 thereby fulfilling their obligation under the amended agreement.
 
          Earnings before interest, other income, reorganization items, special
 and restructuring charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization and
 extraordinary items ("EBITDA") was $84.8 million, or 17.0% of revenues for the
 year ended September 30, 1998. This compares to EBITDA of $83.7 million, or
 18.1% of revenues, and $84.2 million, or 17.3% of revenues for the years ended
 September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Excluding the Kodak payment of $3.6
 million described above, EBITDA for fiscal 1997 was $80.1 million or 17.3% of
 revenues.
 
 FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 VS. FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997
 
          REVENUES. The Company's revenues increased 7.9% from $462.5 million in
 fiscal 1997 to $499.0 million in fiscal 1998. The Company experienced increased
 revenues of $49.2 million and $11.5 million in its Outsource Services and Output
 Systems business lines, respectively, while experiencing decreasing revenues of
 $20.2 million in its Micrographic Supplies product lines.
 
          The $49.2 million increase in Outsource Service revenues was primarily
 due to the acquisition of First Image and the inclusion of its operating results
 for the four months ending September 30, 1998 ($37.7 million). Additionally,
 excluding the results of the First Image, COM service volumes increased by
 approximately 23% while average selling prices decreased by approximately 12%.
 Certain data center acquisitions in Europe and several large customer gains
 contributed to both the increase in volumes and the decrease in average selling
 prices.
 
          The $11.5 million increase in Output Systems revenues was primarily due
 to a $6.8 million increase in COM systems sales which was the result of both an
 increase in the number of units sold as well as the pricing of new and used
 systems. The Company sold or leased 140 XFP 2000 units in fiscal 1998 compared
 to 135 in fiscal 1997. Digital systems revenues increased by $4.7 million which
 was primarily the result of the Com-Informatic acquisition that was consummated
 in October 1997.
 
          The $20.2 million decrease in Micrographics Supplies revenues was the
 result of the Company's discontinuance of the sale of duplicate film to the
 reseller market, as well as declining sales of original COM film and duplicate
 film, which is consistent with long-term trends.
 
          GROSS MARGIN. The Company's gross margins increased 7.4% from $154.4
 million (33.6% of revenues) in fiscal 1997 to $166.4 million (33.3% of revenues)
 in fiscal 1998 (excluding the Kodak payment in fiscal 1997). Gross margins as a
 percentage of revenues remained relatively flat on a consolidated basis although
 there were fluctuations within certain business lines. Gross margins generated
 by Outsource Services decreased as a percent of revenue by 3.4% which was
 primarily the result of decreases in COM services average selling prices. The
 decrease in average selling prices was in part due to the large customer gains
 which received favorable pricing due to their large volumes and acquisitions
 which increased sales volume at lower average 
 
                                       19
 
 <PAGE>
 
 selling prices. Gross margins generated by COM systems sales as a percent of 
 revenue increased by approximately 5.3% which was primarily due to product 
 mix and the result of manufacturing efficiencies realized during fiscal 1998.
 
          SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
 administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 11.4% from $87.4 million (18.9% of
 revenues) in fiscal 1997 to $97.3 million (19.5% of revenues) in fiscal 1998.
 This increase is primarily due to the increased expenses associated with the
 First Image and Com-Informatic acquisitions. Additionally, the Company increased
 its sales efforts, sales support and product development for the digital systems
 products. The Company experienced lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of
 revenues (18.1% of revenues) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. This
 decrease in SG&A was the result of additional revenues from First Image along
 with the benefit from sales force reductions which occurred in the third
 quarter.
 
          AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS . Amortization of intangible assets
 increased 264.0% from $3.4 million (1.0% of revenues) in fiscal 1997 to $12.3
 million (2.5% of revenues) in fiscal 1998. This increase is primarily due to the
 amortization of goodwill associated with the First Image acquisition.
 
          RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. Restructuring charges totaled $8.5 million (1.7%
 of revenues) in fiscal 1998. These charges resulted from the Company's
 acquisition of First Image as the Company plans to close down Anacomp sites with
 multiple market presence in certain cities and convert First Image customers to
 Anacomp equipment. These restructuring activities are expected to be completed
 during fiscal year 1999. The restructuring charges consist of personnel related
 costs of $2.7 million, facility closedown costs of $4.8 million, and other costs
 of $1.0 million. The Company incurred $1.1 million of personnel costs primarily
 related to severance expenditures and $0.4 million of other administrative costs
 during the year ended September 30, 1998.
 
          INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased 6.9% from $35.9 million in
 fiscal 1997 to $34.6 million in fiscal 1998. This decrease was the result of the
 Company refinancing substantially all of its debt obligations at lower interest
 rates during fiscal 1998 and 1997 which was partially offset by additional
 borrowings used to finance the acquisition of First Image. The Company is
 currently anticipating that interest expense will increase to levels similar to
 that which was experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. Interest
 expense increased $2.3 million from $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal
 1997 to $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998.
 
          PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes in fiscal
 1998 includes $5.0 million on earnings of Anacomp's foreign subsidiaries and
 $0.8 million of domestic taxes after considering the impact of the extraordinary
 loss. Of the $0.8 million domestic tax provision, approximately $0.4 million is
 currently payable. The Company's effective tax rate decreased by approximately
 3% from 45% of taxable income in fiscal 1997 to 42% of taxable income in 1998.
 This decrease was primarily due to a substantial portion of the taxable income
 being generated in countries with lower income tax rates relative to the prior
 period. See Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for
 further discussion.
 
 FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 VS. FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996
 
          REVENUES. The Company's revenues decreased 4.9% from $486.1 million in
 fiscal 1996 to $462.5 million in fiscal 1997. The Company experienced decreased
 revenues of $18.8 million and $9.4 million in its Micrographic Supplies and
 Magnetic Media business lines, respectively, which was offset by increased
 revenues of $7.2 million in its Output Systems product lines.
 
          The $18.8 million decrease in Micrographic Supplies revenues includes a
 decrease of $8.3 million related to the discontinuance and downsizing of
 selected product lines initiated in fiscal 1996. The remaining decrease was
 consistent with the projected market trends for reader and reader/printers,
 original COM film, duplicate film and other accessories.
 
          The Magnetic Media revenues decreased by $9.4 million due to expected
 declining sales in several major product categories including 3480 tape
 cartridges ($5.9 million), open reel tape ($7.7 million) and TK 50/52 tape ($2.0
 million). These decreases were partially offset by new contributions of $5.8
 million from metal particle tape products.
 
                                       20
 
 <PAGE>
 
          The $7.2 million increase in Output Systems revenues is primarily
 attributable to digital systems sales. Digital systems sales increased by $9.3
 million which was primarily the result of the revenue contribution from the
 DataWare acquisition that was consummated in January 1997. Prior to that
 acquisition, there were no digital system sales. These sales were offset by a
 $2.1 million decrease in COM systems revenues. This reduction resulted from an
 increase in 1997 in the number of COM system units shipped under operating lease
 arrangements, and a decrease in the number of systems shipped under straight
 sales arrangements along with a change in the mix and pricing of new and used
 systems
 
          GROSS MARGIN. The Company's gross margins increased by less than 2% as
 a percentage of revenues from $155.0 million (31.9% of revenues) in fiscal 1996
 to $154.4 million (33.6% of revenues) in fiscal 1997 (the fiscal 1997 margin
 excludes the Kodak payment). Gross margins remained relatively flat on a
 consolidated basis although there were fluctuations within certain business
 lines. Gross margins generated by Outsource Services decreased as a percent of
 revenue by approximately 3% which was primarily the result of a decrease in COM
 services average selling prices. Data center acquisitions and several large
 customer gains resulted in increased volumes with a corresponding decrease in
 average selling prices. Gross margins generated by Technical Services as a
 percent of revenue increased by approximately 7% which was primarily due to cost
 reduction efforts in maintenance services initiated by new management. Output
 Systems gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by approximately 12%
 due to a change in product mix with a greater portion of sales represented by
 refurbished systems which have higher margins.
 
          SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SG&A expenses increased
 less than 1% from $87.2 million (17.9% of revenues) in fiscal 1996 to $87.4
 million (18.9% of revenues) in fiscal 1997. This increase was primarily the
 result of transition costs associated with the Company's fiscal 1997 acquisition
 activity.
 
          INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased 7.8% from $39.6 million in
 fiscal 1996 to $35.9 million in fiscal 1997. This decrease was primarily due to
 the Company's refinancing efforts in fiscal 1997 and its improved debt structure
 as a result of the Company's reorganization in fiscal 1996.
 
          PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes in fiscal
 1997 includes $5.4 million on earnings from Anacomp's foreign subsidiaries and
 $4.2 million of domestic taxes after considering the impact of the extraordinary
 loss. Of the $4.2 million domestic tax provision, approximately $0.7 million is
 currently payable. See Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial
 Statements for further discussion.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
          During the period ended September 30, 1998, Anacomp issued $135 million
 of 10 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes which proceeds were used to fund the First
 Image acquisition. As of September 30, 1998 the Company had $335 million of 10
 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding. Interest on these notes is payable
 semi-annually and the notes are due in April, 2004.
 
          Anacomp's working capital at September 30, 1998, excluding the current
 portion of long-term debt, was $17.7 million, compared to $41.4 million at
 September 30, 1997. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $24.6
 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, compared to $57.8 million
 in the comparable prior period. Fiscal 1997 benefited from $12 million in
 non-cash interest expense and significant reductions in long-term lease
 receivables and inventory. Fiscal 1998 did not include the same benefits and, in
 addition, current liabilities were significantly reduced during the year.
 
          Net cash used in investing activities was $143.4 million in the current
 period, compared to $32.8 million in the comparable prior period. This change
 was primarily the result of the First Image acquisition in the current period.
 
          Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $79.6 million
 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, compared to a net use of $5.1
 million in the comparable prior period. This change was primarily the result of
 the Company's issuance of $135 million of 10 7/8% Senior Subordinated notes
 during the current period which was offset by the pay off of senior indebtedness
 outstanding at the end of fiscal 1997.

          The Company's cash balance (including restricted cash) as of September
 30, 1998 was $22.0 million, compared to $65.5 million at September 30, 1997. The
 Company also has available an $80 million revolving credit facility. There were
 no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 30,
 1998.
 
          The Company has significant debt service obligations. The ability of
 the Company to meet its debt service and other obligations will depend upon its
 future performance and is subject to financial, economic and other factors, some
 of which are beyond its control. However, the Company believes that cash on hand
 and cash generated from operations and cash available under the revolving credit
 facility will be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements, acquisition
 strategies and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
 
 YEAR 2000
 
          Anacomp has undertaken a comprehensive "year 2000" program for the
 products that it sells or distributes in the marketplace. Under this program,
 the Company has assessed all of its critical software and hardware products to
 determine what remediation, if any, is necessary for the proper functioning of
 these systems in the year 2000 and beyond. The Company has worked with its
 outside vendors to ensure that they will continue to support the products that
 the vendors supply to Anacomp for resale, including the performance by the
 vendors of any required year 2000 remediation. Anacomp has also analyzed and
 updated for year 2000 purposes certain software and hardware systems that it
 uses internally. The Company continues to consider year 2000 issues for all new
 products and services as well as those in development or included in business
 acquisitions.
 
      STATE OF READINESS
 
          Anacomp's overall state of readiness can be assessed by describing its
 specific readiness in four key areas, namely its products and services, its
 vendors' and suppliers' products and services, its internal systems, and its
 products in development.
 
          Anacomp has completed the assessment, remediation and year 2000 testing
 phases of nearly all supported products and services, including those
 responsible for generating the material portion of its revenues. The Company is
 currently in the remediation phase of its electronic data transmission project.
 Anacomp summarizes the status of each completed product or service in a written
 report to the Company's year 2000 steering committee, for archiving in the
 Company's year 2000 database. These processes have been reviewed and approved by
 a third party consultant retained for this purpose.
 
          The implementation phase of the Company's year 2000 project depends on
 the response of the Company's customers who may require upgrades or migration
 paths. Anacomp is in the process of communicating with identified customers and
 has no reason to believe that all customers who require upgrades or migration
 will not receive them. To this end, Anacomp has offered financial incentives to
 encourage early responses and avoid peak demand loads, although no assurance can
 be made that the demand will be spread sufficiently to eliminate delays in
 implementation. Anacomp has also launched its "Analog as a Fail Safe" campaign
 to educate customers about the value of COM and microfilm as a way to minimize
 the risk of the year 2000. Although customers may divert expenditures away from
 these products and services in order to fund other year 2000 remediation,
 Anacomp encourages customers to consider these products and services as a
 cost-effective backup to digital storage because retrieval of data stored on
 microfilm does not require digital technology.
 
          The Company has requested that approximately 1,000 of its vendors and
 suppliers answer a year 2000 readiness questionnaire and has sent a follow-up
 letter and questionnaire to each of approximately 200 key vendors and suppliers
 who did not reply to the first mailing. Anacomp is in the process of reviewing
 the responses for their likely impact on the Company. For those Anacomp products
 which incorporate the products of a third party supplier, Anacomp requests that
 its suppliers disclose test procedures and results. Anacomp has also requested
 that its vendors in the human resources area, such as its retirement, health and
 insurance providers, respond in writing as to their readiness, but there can be
 no assurance that such vendors will either respond or achieve readiness in a
 timely fashion.

          Anacomp has identified all internal software and hardware products used
 in its corporate headquarters in Poway, California, including those used to
 assimilate and report financial information and to handle billing, collections
 and electronic commerce. In those instances where remediation or renovation was
 required, Anacomp has either completed or has nearly completed such remediation
 or renovation. Anacomp is in the process of completing the documentation of such
 efforts for its year 2000 archives.
 
          The Company continues to develop new products and services and acquire
 new businesses. Anacomp develops and tests each new product, sometimes with the
 assistance of an outside consultant, for year 2000 readiness. Businesses which
 Anacomp acquires, such as First Image, are subject to the same assessment,
 remediation, testing and implementation phases as those described above.
 
      COSTS
 
          Anacomp estimates that total expenditures on its year 2000 project,
 including costs of outside parties such as consultants and attorneys, costs of
 hardware and software remediation, internal labor, travel and out of pocket
 expenses to be approximately $0.3, $2.3, and $1.2 million in fiscal year 1997,
 1998, and 1999, respectively. These figures include estimates from the
 engineering, manufacturing, legal and information technology departments of the
 Company.
 
      RISKS
 
          There can be no assurance that the Company and its vendors and
 suppliers will be able to identify all year 2000 issues before problems manifest
 themselves or to complete all remediation in the required time frame. Further,
 it is possible that the future level of expenses in the Company's remediation
 efforts could rise significantly.
 
          The Company relies upon the continuous provision of services from third
 parties such as electrical and telecommunication utilities around the world, and
 the Company plans to enhance its electronic data transmission capabilities. Any
 sustained disruption of service or capability could adversely impact the
 Company's ability to operate its business. Finally, there can be no assurance
 that, if left unremedied, the products or services that the Company sells or
 distributes would remain competitive in the marketplace or the products that the
 Company uses internally would not have a material effect upon the ability of the
 Company to report its financial results.
 
      CONTINGENCY PLANS
 
          In those instances where the Company determines that year 2000 problems
 with its operational facilities may not be identified or remediated in time, the
 Company believes that its business will still be able to function without
 substantial interruption. For example, COM services provided in a data center
 which experiences a loss of power due to a third party utility's failure to
 identify or remediate an isolated year 2000 problem could be shifted to another
 data center without substantial interruption. In addition, electronic
 transmission of data could be replaced with manual delivery of data upon
 completion of certain modifications. In those instances where an installed COM
 customer experiences a year 2000 problem while operating its own COM equipment,
 Anacomp could offer its COM services to the customer at one of its data centers
 upon completion of certain modifications. This seamless nature of many of
 Anacomp's products and services forms the basis of Anacomp's ongoing contingency
 planning.
 
 ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
          In June 1997, the FASB issued two additional pronouncements related to
 reporting comprehensive income and disclosure of segment information. These two
 pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
 The Company has not yet determined the additional disclosures specified by these
 pronouncements on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
 September 30, 1998, which will be reported during fiscal 1999.

 EURO CURRENCY
 
          Many of the countries in which the Company sells its products and
 services are Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union ("EMU"). Beginning
 January 1, 1999, Member States of the EMU may begin trading in either their
 local currencies or the euro, the official currency of EMU participating Member
 States. Parties are free to choose the unit they prefer in contractual
 relationships during the transitional period, beginning January 1999 and ending
 June 2002. The Company's computer system contains the functionality to process
 transactions in either a country's local currency or the euro. The Company does
 not currently anticipate any material adverse effects on its operations related
 to the EMU's conversion to the euro. However, there can be no assurance that the
 conversion of EMU Member States to euro will not have a material adverse effect
 on the Company and its operations.
