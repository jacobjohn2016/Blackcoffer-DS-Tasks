         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 
     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
 condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine
 months ended September 30, 1998 and September 28, 1997.
 
 ACQUISITIONS
 
     On March 30, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired
 approximately 81% of the total number of then outstanding shares of common stock
 of The Coleman Company, Inc. ("Coleman"), in exchange for 14,099,749 shares of
 the Company's common stock and approximately $160 million in cash as well as the
 assumption of $1,016 million in debt. The Company expects to acquire the
 remaining equity interest in Coleman pursuant to a merger transaction in which
 the existing Coleman minority shareholders will receive approximately 6.7
 million shares of common stock and approximately $87 million in cash. Although
 there can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger will occur in
 the first half of fiscal 1999. (See Note 2 to the condensed consolidated
 financial statements.) Coleman is a leading manufacturer and marketer of
 consumer products for the worldwide outdoor recreation market. Its products have
 been sold domestically under the Coleman /registered trademark/ brand name since
 the 1920's.
 
     On April 6, 1998, the Company completed the cash acquisitions of First
 Alert, Inc. ("First Alert"), a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide
 detectors, and Signature Brands USA, Inc. ("Signature Brands"), a leading
 manufacturer of consumer and professional products. The First Alert and the
 Signature Brands acquisitions were valued at approximately $178 million and $253
 million, respectively, including the assumption of debt.
 
     The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting; and
 accordingly, the results of operations of each acquired entity are included in
 the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from the
 respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired entities
 have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
 on preliminary estimates of fair market values at the dates of acquisition. The
 purchase price allocations for the acquisitions will be revised when additional
 information concerning asset and liability valuations is obtained. Adjustments,
 which could be significant, will be made during the allocation periods based on
 detailed reviews of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 and could result in a substantial change in goodwill and other intangible
 assets.
 
     To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company and the acquired
 entities, effective with its 1998 fiscal year, the Company has changed its
 fiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December 31 to a calendar year. (See
 Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)
 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
 28, 1997
 
     Results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 1998 include
 the results of the acquired entities for the entire period. The acquired
 entities generated net sales of $326.1 million in the quarter with corresponding
 gross margin of $75.2 million, or 23% of sales. SG&A costs recorded by the
 acquired entities were $84.3 million in the period, yielding an operating loss
 of $9.1 million. Included in cost of sales of the acquired entities for the
 quarter was approximately $10 million of expense related to purchase accounting
 adjustments which require adjusting the values of acquired inventories to fair
 market value at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, as these inventories are
 sold, the purchase accounting adjustments related to these inventories (in this
 case, increases in inventory values) are reflected in cost of sales. A year ago,
 for the full quarter, these businesses generated sales approximately $18 million
 higher than occurred in the third quarter of 1998. The majority of this decrease
 occurred at Coleman where sales were impacted by fewer product lines resulting
 from the sale of a portion of the business and exiting the pressure washer
 business during 1997. First Alert sales were adversely impacted by higher
 returns, as compared with the same period a year ago. Additionally, each
 acquired business experienced a general disruption due to the acquisitions and
 management changes. Excluding the impact of the purchase accounting adjustments
 described above, gross margins in the acquired entities were $19 million lower
 in 1998 as compared with their results in the prior year. Lower sales in the
 acquired entities accounted for approximately 30% of this change. Coleman
 recorded $5.3 million in third quarter charges for excess and obsolete inventory
 and a provision for fixed assets, as described in Note 3 to the condensed
 consolidated financial statements. In addition, an adverse sales mix at
 Signature Brands and recent developments on existing environmental remediation
 at Coleman which resulted in an increase in the environmental provision
 accounted for the majority of the remaining decrease in margins as compared with
 those reported by the acquired entities a year ago.

     Net sales as reported by Sunbeam is comprised of gross sales less provisions
 for estimated customer returns, discounts, promotional allowances, cooperative
 advertising allowances and costs incurred by the Company to ship product to
 customers. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 1998 were $496.0
 million, an increase of $209.2 million versus the three months ended September
 28, 1997. After excluding: (i) $326.1 million from 1998 sales generated by the
 acquired entities, as discussed above; (ii) approximately $2 million from 1998
 sales related to the change in fiscal period, as discussed in Note 1 to the
 condensed consolidated financial statements, and (iii) $5.4 million from 1998
 and $7.6 million from 1997 sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which
 the inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value,
 net sales on an adjusted basis ("Adjusted Sales") were $162.6 million in 1998, a
 42% decrease from $279.2 million in the third quarter of 1997. Overall, Adjusted
 Sales for the third quarter of 1998 as compared with the prior year were
 adversely impacted by increasing retail inventory positions in 1997 as compared
 with decreasing retail inventory positions in 1998, distribution losses and
 sales timing issues. In addition, the historical Sunbeam operations were
 adversely impacted by disruption from acquisition activities and management
 changes in the period.
 
     Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately $89 million from the third
 quarter of 1997. The Company believes approximately half of the decline in sales
 between years was attributable to the changes in retail inventory positions.
 Excluding the impact of the change in retail inventories between periods, the
 decline in sales was attributable to lower sales levels throughout the business.
 The single largest component of this decrease in sales was attributable to
 timing issues related to sales of Personal Care and Comfort products. This
 decrease as compared with a year ago is expected to be largely recovered in the
 fourth quarter. Appliance product sales were adversely impacted by significant
 price reductions for breadmakers. Distribution losses for grills, appliances and
 Health at Home products accounted for the majority of the remaining sales
 decrease as compared with last year's third quarter.
 
     International sales, which represented 19% of Adjusted Sales in the third
 quarter of 1998, were just over half the level achieved in the third quarter of
 1997's Adjusted Sales. The Company believes this sales decline was due to three
 key reasons: decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with the prior
 year; a decision to stop selling to certain Latin American export distributors,
 and poor economic conditions in Latin America.
 
     Excluding: (i) the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquired
 entities' operations in the quarter, as discussed above, and (ii) the impact in
 1998 of the change in the fiscal period, as discussed in Note 1 to the condensed
 consolidated financial statements, gross margin declined to a loss of $8.0
 million for the third quarter of 1998 versus a profit of $76.5 million for the
 same period a year ago. The decrease in sales volume between periods, coupled
 with adverse manufacturing variances and increases in estimated warranty
 reserves accounted for the majority of the decrease in margins. The adverse
 manufacturing variances as compared with the third quarter of 1997 arose from
 lower manufacturing activities in the current year resulting from the high
 levels of inventory on hand and a less robust demand forecast than existed a
 year ago. Operating results will be adversely impacted due to higher inventory
 carrying costs and unabsorbed fixed factory overhead during the remainder of the
 year.
 
     Excluding the effect of: (i) $84.3 million of SG&A charges from the acquired
 entities; (ii) $70 million related to warrants issued in the period, as
 discussed in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements; (iii)
 approximately $1.5 million of costs due to the change in fiscal periods; (iii)
 $16.9 million of costs incurred in 1998 related to the restatement efforts and
 related litigation, Year 2000 remediation and costs of relocating the corporate
 office; (iv) $4.0 million in 1998 for severance and other costs resulting from
 the change in management, net of the reversal of certain compensation costs
 recorded in the first quarter as discussed in Note 9 to the condensed
 consolidated financial statements; (v) $7.3 million of benefit in the third
 quarter of 1997 from the reversal of reserves no longer required, including the
 restructuring reserve reversal, as shown in Note 6 to the condensed consolidated
 financial statements; and (vi) $2.5 million of restructuring related charges
 recorded in 1997, SG&A expenses were $51.7 million in 1998, approximately 43%
 higher than the same period in 1997. Higher freight and warehousing costs
 resulting from the higher inventory levels in 1998 along with higher costs
 related to customer service resulted in nearly $4 million of the increase in
 costs between years. Increases in required legal and environmental reserves led
 to approximately $4 million higher costs between years. Travel and relocation,
 higher outside service costs and other general SG&A cost increases between years
 account for the remaining change.
 
     Operating results for the third quarters of 1998 and 1997, on an adjusted
 basis as described above, were a loss of $59.7 million in 1998 and a profit of
 $40.3 million in 1997. This change resulted from the factors discussed above.
 
     Interest expense increased from $2.9 million in the third quarter of 1997 to
 $42.7 million in the third quarter of 1998 primarily related to higher borrowing
 levels in 1998 for the acquisitions. (See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated
 financial statements.)
 
     Other income, net in 1998 of $11.0 million included approximately $8 million
 from the settlement of a lawsuit. The remaining other income, net in 1998 and
 the $1.3 million recognized in 1997 were from favorable foreign exchange,
 primarily from Mexico.
 
     The minority interest reported for the third quarter of 1998 relates to the
 minority interest held in Coleman by public shareholders.
 
                                        18

     Income taxes in the third quarter of 1998 reflect taxes benefits on earnings
 of foreign operations. A valuation allowance has been provided in 1998 for
 deferred tax assets generated by Sunbeam's operations. The 1997 rate was higher
 than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local
 taxes plus the effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates.
 
     Due to increased inventory positions at certain customers which resulted
 from sales in 1997 and the first quarter of 1998, as well as increased inventory
 positions at the Company, sales and operating income will be affected in the
 fourth quarter of 1998 and into 1999. Future results are also expected to be
 impacted materially by charges related to, among other items, changes in
 business operations resulting in part from acquisitions in 1998, interest costs
 associated with higher debt levels, asset impairment costs, as well as costs
 related to Year 2000 issues. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources", below, and
 Notes 2, 3, 6, and 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
 28, 1997
 
     Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 include
 the results of Coleman for March 30 and 31, 1998 and the entire second and third
 quarters and of Signature Brands and First Alert from April 6, 1998. The
 acquired entities generated net sales of $717.2 million in the period since the
 acquisitions with corresponding gross margin of $158.3 million, or 22% of sales.
 SG&A costs recorded by the acquired entities were $163.9 million in the period,
 yielding an operating loss of $5.6 million. Included in cost of sales of the
 acquired entities was approximately $30 million of expense related to purchase
 accounting adjustments which require adjusting the values of acquired
 inventories to fair market value at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, as
 these inventories are sold, the purchase accounting adjustments related to these
 inventories (in this case, increases in inventory values) are reflected in cost
 of sales. A year ago, on a year-to-date basis, sales of the acquired entities
 were approximately $140 million higher than in the comparable nine months of
 1998 due to: a decrease in product lines at Coleman resulting from the sale of a
 portion of the business, a program to reduce SKU's and exiting the pressure
 washer business in 1997; softness in demand resulting from the domestic retail
 channel's efforts to lower inventory levels; adverse economic conditions in
 Japan and Southeast Asia; product availability issues at Signature Brands;
 higher sales returns at First Alert, and general disruption in the acquired
 entities due to the acquisitions and management changes. Excluding the impact of
 the purchase accounting adjustments described above, gross margins generated by
 the acquired entities were $65 million lower in 1998 than for the prior
 year-to-date period. Approximately 60% of the change resulted from the lower
 sales in 1998. An adverse sales mix at Signature Brands and charges at Coleman
 and Signature Brands in 1998 related to inventory reserves, provisions for fixed
 assets and environmental remediation accounted for the majority of the remaining
 decline in margins as compared with operations in the acquired entities for the
 first nine months of 1997.
 
     Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 were $1,322.1
 million, an increase of $511.4 million versus the nine months ended September
 28, 1997. After excluding: (i) $717.2 million of sales generated by the acquired
 entities, as discussed above; (ii) approximately $6 million of higher sales in
 1998 resulting from the change in fiscal year end, as described in Note 1 to the
 condensed consolidated financial statements; (iii) $5.4 million in 1998 and
 $25.7 million from 1997 sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which the
 inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value; (iv)
 $4.2 million from 1997 sales relating to divested product lines which are not
 classified as discontinued operations (time and temperature products and
 Counselor / registered trademark/ and Borg /registered trademark/ branded
 scales), and (v) a $4.0 million benefit from the reduction of cooperative
 advertising accruals no longer required in 1997, net sales on an adjusted basis
 ("Adjusted Sales") of $594.0 million decreased approximately 24% from $776.8
 million in the first nine months of 1997. Overall, product sales were adversely
 impacted by changes in retail inventory levels, price discounting and higher
 provisions for estimated returns, costs to ship products to customers, rebates
 and other customer allowances.
 
     Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately 25% or $149 million from the
 first three quarters of 1997. The Company believes more than half of the sales
 decline was due to increasing retail inventory levels in 1997 versus decreasing
 inventory positions at customers in 1998. Excluding this effect, sales were
 still lower than the prior year throughout the business, with the most
 significant decline occurring in Outdoor Cooking products sales. During 1997,
 the Company lost a significant portion of its Outdoor Cooking products
 distribution, including the majority of its grill parts and accessories products
 distribution. The Outdoor Cooking products sales decline was attributable to
 this lost distribution, to price discounting and higher customer allowances.
 Appliance Adjusted Sales declined between years as a result of higher provisions
 for returns, freight and co-operative advertising allowances in 1998, lost
 distribution and price erosion on breadmakers. The sales decline in Personal
 Care and Comfort products arose principally in the third quarter and was
 primarily due to sales timing issues which are generally expected to be
 recovered in the fourth quarter.
 
     International sales, which represented 23% of Adjusted Sales for the first
 three quarters of 1998, decreased approximately 20% compared with the Adjusted
 Sales for the same period a year ago. The Company believes this sales decline
 was primarily attributable to decreasing customer inventory levels as compared
 with the prior year. Sales were also adversely impacted by a decision to stop
 selling to certain export distributors in Latin America and by poor economic
 conditions in that region. In addition, lost distribution in Canada contributed
 to the sales decline from the prior year.

     Excluding: (i) the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquired
 entities' operations in the period, as discussed above; (ii) the impact of the
 change in fiscal year-end as discussed in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated
 financial statements; (iii) $109.8 million in charges recorded in the second
 quarter of 1998 related to excess inventory and fixed assets; (iii) $4.0 million
 from the benefit in 1997 of reducing the cooperative advertising accrual no
 longer required, and (iv) a $2.8 million benefit recorded in the second quarter
 of 1997 resulting from capitalizing certain manufacturing supplies inventories
 which were previously expensed, gross margin declined to a loss of $0.6 million
 for the first nine months of 1998 versus $183.2 million for the same period a
 year ago. Lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies from
 lower production levels associated with the lower sales volumes and high
 inventory levels in 1998 accounted for approximately 50% of the change between
 years. Approximately 30% of the decrease is attributable to lower price
 realization and higher costs of customer allowances, rebates and similar
 incentives in 1998, higher product return reserves and an adverse product sales
 mix in 1998. The adverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of a
 majority of the grill accessory products distribution. Accessories generate
 significantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills. During
 the first half of each year, grill and grill accessory sales are traditionally a
 higher portion of overall sales in the period than during other quarters of the
 year. Costs associated with a blanket recall, higher warranty reserves and
 certain adjustments related to physical inventories drove the remaining
 increases in cost of goods sold.
 
     Excluding the effect of: (i) $163.9 million of SG&A charges in the acquired
 entities; (ii) $70 million recorded in the second quarter of 1998 related to the
 issuance of warrants; (iii) approximately $2.3 million of SG&A expense in 1998
 from the change in the fiscal period; (iv) a $5.9 million benefit in the first
 nine months of 1998 and an $8.2 million benefit in the same period in 1997 from
 the reversal of reserves no longer required; (v) $34.4 million of charges
 recorded in 1998 related to compensation and severance for certain former
 employees; (vi) $16.9 million of costs incurred in 1998 related to the
 restatement efforts, Year 2000 remediation and the corporate office relocation,
 and (vii) $11.9 million of restructuring related charges recorded in 1997, SG&A
 expenses were $158.8 million in 1998, 48% higher than the same period in 1997.
 This increase is due in part to approximately $8 million in higher advertising
 and marketing costs between years due to a national television advertising
 campaign for grills, package redesign costs and market research. Higher
 inventory levels in 1998 and costs associated with outsourcing small parts
 fulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousing costs which were $10
 million greater than a year ago. Corporate administrative costs were
 approximately $28 million higher between years, resulting primarily from
 increases in outside service provider fees, including telephone charges, travel
 and relocation fees, higher legal and environmental reserves and other general
 administrative costs. Higher bad debt charges in 1998 accounted for the majority
 of the remaining increase in SG&A costs between years. These bad debt charges
 resulted nearly equally from collection issues with certain customers in the
 U.S. and in Latin America.
 
     Operating results for the first three quarters of 1998 and 1997, on an
 adjusted basis as described above, were a loss of $159.4 million in 1998 and a
 profit of $75.8 million in 1997. This change resulted from the factors discussed
 above.
 
     Interest expense increased from $7.8 million in the first nine months of
 1997 to $90.1 million for the same period in 1998. Approximately 80% of the
 change related to higher borrowing levels in 1998 for the acquisitions, with the
 remainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital and the operating
 losses. (See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)
 
     Other income, in 1998 net of $5.7 million included approximately $8 million
 from the settlement of a lawsuit. Excluding this amount, there was approximately
 $2.3 million of net losses from foreign exchange in the period. In 1998, net
 foreign exchange gains accounted for the majority of the $0.9 million other
 income. The foreign exchange gains and losses in each year are primarily from
 results in Mexico.
 
     The minority interest reported in 1998 relates to the minority interest held
 in Coleman by public shareholders.
 
     Income taxes in 1998 reflect taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries and
 franchise taxes. A valuation allowance has been provided in 1998 for deferred
 tax assets generated by Sunbeam's operations. The 1997 rate was higher than the
 federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus
 the effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates.
 
     In 1998, the Company prepaid certain debt assumed in the acquisitions and
 prepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. In
 connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized an
 extraordinary charge of $111.7 million ($1.16 per share).
 
     The Company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March 1997,
 had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the sale and
 nominal earnings for that period. As a result of the sale of the Company's
 furniture business assets (primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment),
 the Company received $69.0 million in cash, retained approximately $50.0 million
 in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities. The final purchase
 price for the furniture business was subject to a post-closing adjustment based
 on the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and in the first quarter of 1997,
 after completion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss on
 disposal of $22.5 million pre-tax.
 
                                        20

 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
     Approximately 80% of the Company's business is conducted in U.S. dollars
 (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarily
 to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of European
 sales). The Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by
 subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and Mexico. Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary
 status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translation adjustments
 related to Mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of net
 earnings. Mexico is not expected to be considered hyperinflationary as of
 January 1, 1999.
 
         While Sunbeam's revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not been
 significant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative
 effect on Coleman's earnings. Economic instability and the political environment
 in Latin America have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that
 sales in and exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as the
 economic environments in those regions remain unsettled.
 
     On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures that
 arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered into
 for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did not have a
 material impact on the Company's financial results in 1998 and 1997. (See Note 3
 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.)
 
 SEASONALITY
 
     On a consolidated basis, the Company's sales have not traditionally
 exhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during the
 fourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of Outdoor Cooking
 products are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of Appliances
 and Personal Care and Comfort products are strongest in the second half of the
 year. Furthermore, sales of a number of the Company's traditional products,
 including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impacted
 by unseasonable weather conditions. After considering the seasonality of the
 acquired entities, the Company's consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit
 substantial seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the
 second quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of many products sold
 by the Company may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert and Signature
 Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the Company and
 the acquired entities, the Company consummated: (i) an offering (the "Offering")
 of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2018 (the
 "Debentures") at a yield to maturity of 5% (approximately $2,014 million
 principal amount at maturity) in March 1998, which resulted in approximately
 $730 million of net proceeds and, (ii) entered into a revolving and term credit
 facility ("New Credit Facility").
 
     The Company was required to file a registration statement with the
 Securities and Exchange Commission to register the Debentures by June 23, 1998,
 which registration statement has not been filed. From June 23, 1998 until the
 day on which the registration statement is filed and declared effective, the
 Company is required to pay to the Debenture holders cash liquidated damages
 accruing, for each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25%
 during the first 90 days and 0.50% thereafter multiplied by the total of the
 issue price of the Debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such
 day. The Company made its first payment of approximately $525,000 to the
 Debenture holders on September 25, 1998. (See Note 3.)
 
     The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to $1.7
 billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
 amount of up to $400 million, maturing March 31, 2005; (ii) an $800 million term
 loan maturing on March 31, 2005, and (iii) a $500 million term loan maturing
 September 30, 2006. Interest accrues at a rate selected at the Company's option
 of: (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an agreed upon interest
 margin which varies depending upon the Company's leverage ratio, as defined, and
 other items or, (ii) the base rate of the administrative agent (generally the
 higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the
 Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%), plus an agreed upon interest margin which
 varies depending upon thE Company's leverage ratio, as defined, and other items.
 The New Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including limitations on the
 ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to engage in certain transactions
 and the requirement to maintain certain financial covenants and ratios.
 
     At June 30, 1998, the Company was not in compliance with the financial
 covenants and ratios required under the New Credit Facility. The Company and its
 lenders entered into an agreement dated June 30, 1998, which provided that
 compliance with the covenants would be waived through December 31, 1998.
 Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by the Company's assets,
 including its stock interest in Coleman. Pursuant to an amendment dated October
 19, 1998, the Company is not required to comply with the original financial
 covenants and ratios under the New Credit Facility until April 10, 1999, but
 will be required to comply with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
 and amortization covenant, the amounts of which are to be determined, beginning
 February 1999. Concurrent with each of these amendments, interest margin was
 increased. The
 
                                        21
 
 <PAGE>
 
 margin continues to increase monthly through March 1999 to a maximum of 400
 basis points over LIBOR. At the end of November 1998, following the scheduled
 repayment of a portion of the term loan, the New Credit Facility was reduced to
 $1,698 million in total, of which approximately $1,421 million was outstanding
 and approximately $277 million was available. In addition, at the same time, the
 Company's cash balance available for debt repayment was approximately $22
 million.
 
     The Company is working closely with its bank lenders in an effort to reach
 agreement on a further amendment to the New Credit Facility containing mutually
 acceptable revised financial covenants. There can be no assurance that such an
 amendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will be
 entered into with the bank lenders by April 10, 1999. The failure to obtain such
 an amendment or further waiver would result in violation of the existing
 covenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all
 outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. Accordingly, the debt
 related to the New Credit Facility and all debt containing cross-default
 provisions is classified as current in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet
 as of September 30, 1998.
 
     At September 30, 1998, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
 $52.1 million. Cash used in operating activities during the first three quarters
 of 1998 was $224.7 million compared to $59.9 million for the same period in
 1997. This increase is attributable to lower earnings before non-cash charges.
 Year-to-date 1998, $75.7 million in cash was generated by reducing receivables
 and a similar amount was used as inventories increased. The majority of this
 cash generation was from Coleman as that operation reduced receivables balances
 generated in its peak second quarter period. The remaining cash usage for
 working capital resulted primarily from reducing accounts payable levels.
 
     Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 1998 reflects
 $379.2 million for the acquisitions. In the first three quarters of 1997, cash
 provided by investing activities reflected $90.9 million in proceeds from the
 sales of divested operations and other assets. Capital spending totaled $32.8
 million in 1998 and was primarily for manufacturing efficiency initiatives,
 equipment and tooling for new products, and management information systems
 hardware and software licenses. The new product capital spending principally
 related to the air and water filtration products which were discontinued in the
 second quarter, electric blankets, grills, clippers and appliances. As the
 Company completes its assessment of expected future performance of its business
 operations, valuation adjustments may be required for certain of the assets
 acquired in 1998. Capital spending in 1997 was $41.0 million and was primarily
 attributable to manufacturing capacity expansion, cost reduction initiatives and
 equipment to manufacture new products. The Company anticipates 1998 capital
 spending to be approximately 5% of sales, primarily related to new product
 introductions, capacity additions and certain facility rationalization
 initiatives.
 
     Cash provided by financing activities totaled $636.1 million in the first
 nine months of 1998 and reflects net proceeds from the Debentures of $729.6
 million, the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the
 Company's $250 million September 1996 revolving credit facility, the repayment
 of certain debt acquired with the acquisitions and the early extinguishment of
 the $75.0 million Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond. In addition, cash
 provided by financing activities includes $19.6 million of proceeds from the
 exercise of stock options. (See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial
 statements.)
 
     The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman
 pursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority
 shareholders will receive approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and
 approximately $87 million in cash. In addition, as a result of litigation
 related to the merger consideration, the Company has entered into a memorandum
 of understanding (subject to court approval) pursuant to which the holders of
 the remaining equity interest in Coleman will also receive five-year warrants to
 purchase 4.98 million shares of Sunbeam common stock at $7.00 per share. There
 can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement as proposed.
 Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated the Coleman merger will
 occur in the first half of fiscal 1999. (See Note 10 to the condensed
 consolidated financial statements.)
 
     The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New Credit Agreement,
 cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquired
 companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable
 securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,
 capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. However, if the
 Company is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants and ratio
 requirements of the New Credit Facility or obtain a further waiver of the
 existing covenants and ratio requirements prior to April 10, 1999, the Company
 expects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the New
 Credit Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require the
 repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility.

 <PAGE>
 
 required to be adopted for periods beginning after December 15, 1997. The
 adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material effect on the
 Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows,
 although actual charges incurred may be material due to Year 2000 issues, as
 discussed below.
 
 YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE AND OPERATING SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS
 
     The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the Year 2000 on
 its operations, including the Coleman, First Alert and Signature Brands
 companies which were acquired by the Company in the spring of 1998. The Company
 established a Year 2000 Program Management Office in the third quarter of 1998
 to conduct such assessment with assistance from three consulting firms. The
 Company's assessment encompasses the Company's information technology functions
 along with the impact of the effects of noncompliance by its vendors, service
 providers, customers, and financial institutions. The assessment of the
 Company's information technology functions is substantially complete.
 Additionally, the Company is assessing the impact of noncompliance of embedded
 microprocessors in its products as well as equipment, such as manufacturing
 equipment, security and telephone systems and controls for lighting,
 heating/ventilation, and facility access.
 
     The Company relies on its information technology functions to perform many
 tasks that are critical to its operations. Significant transactions that could
 be impacted by Year 2000 noncompliance include, among others, purchases of
 materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payroll
 processing. Systems and applications that have been identified by the Company to
 date as not currently Year 2000 compliant and which are critical to the
 Company's operations include its financial software systems, which process the
 order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts
 receivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in the
 Company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehouse
 management application. The Company plans to complete corrective work with
 respect to the Company's systems by the second quarter of 1999 with final
 testing and implementation of such systems occurring in the second and third
 quarters of 1999. Management believes that, although there are significant
 systems that will need to be modified or replaced, the Company's information
 systems environment will be made Year 2000 compliant prior to January 1, 2000.
 The Company's failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a
 material adverse impact on the Company. The Company is not able to estimate
 possible lost profits arising from such failure.
 
     The Company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers of
 products and services to determine their Year 2000 readiness and plans. This
 review includes third party providers to whom the Company has outsourced the
 processing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions. The Company
 plans to complete this review during the first quarter of 1999. The failure of
 certain of these third party suppliers to become Year 2000 compliant could have
 a material adverse impact on the Company.
 
             The Company's preliminary assessment of the total costs to address
 and remedy Year 2000 issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs
 for the acquired companies, is $50 million. This estimate includes the costs of
 software and hardware modifications and replacements and fees to third party
 consultants, but excludes internal resources. The Company expects these
 expenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, as
 applicable. Through September 30, 1998, the Company had expended approximately
 $10 million related to new systems and remediation to address Year 2000 issues
 of which approximately half was recorded as capital expenditures. Of the total
 costs, it is anticipated that approximately 25% to 30% will be incurred by
 year-end 1998, with the remainder in 1999. A significant portion of these
 expenditures will enhance the Company's operating systems in addition to
 resolving the Year 2000 issues. As the Company completes its assessment of the
 Year 2000 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ
 materially from the amounts shown above.
 
     After completing the assessment of the Year 2000 on its operations, the
 Company plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of the
 Year 2000 on its operations, whether due to noncompliance of the Company's
 systems or those of third parties. The Company expects to complete such
 contingency plan by September 30, 1999; such contingency plan will address
 alternative processes, such as manual procedures to replace those processed by
 noncompliant systems, potential alternative service providers, and plans to
 address compliance issues as they arise. Subject to the nature of the systems
 and applications which are not made Year 2000 compliant, the impact of such
 non-compliance on the Company's operations could be material if appropriate
 contingency plans cannot be developed prior to January 1, 2000.

 1997 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1996
 
     The results of operations previously reported for the three months ended
 September 28, 1997 as compared with the three months ended September 29, 1996
 generally understated the level of expenses incurred in that year. Gross margin
 was previously reported to have improved 18.3 percentage points from the level
 achieved in the third quarter of 1996. After restatement, the gross margin
 improvement was 14.3 percentage points. Operating income was previously reported
 to have improved $75.6 million to 19.0% of sales, up 27.9 percentage points from
 1996's third quarter. After reflecting the results of the restatement, operating
 earnings were $45.1 million for the third quarter of 1997, an improvement of
 $65.8 million. Operating earnings were 15.7% of sales in 1997, after
 restatement, up 24.6 percentage points from the prior year. On November 12,
 1998, the Company filed a Form 10-K/A setting forth the restated financial
 statements for December 28, 1997 and December 29. 1996, and the fiscal years
 then ended. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
 Results of Operations for the fiscal years 1997 and 1996 as well as 1996 and
 1995 are contained therein. (See Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial
 statements.)
 
 RESTATEMENT OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28,
 1997 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1996
 
     The results of operations previously reported for the nine months ended
 September 28, 1997 as compared with the nine months ended September 29, 1996
 generally overstated sales in 1997 and understated the level of expenses
 incurred in 1997. Gross margin was previously reported to have improved 10.5
 percentage points from the level achieved in 1996. After restatement, the gross
 margin improvement was 6.1 percentage points. Operating income for the first
 nine months of 1997 was previously reported to have improved $128.6 million to
 16.0% of sales, up 15.5 percentage points from 1996's first nine months'
 results. After reflecting the results of the restatement, operating earnings
 were $79.0 million for the first three quarters of 1997, an improvement of $75.0
 million from the prior year. As a percent of sales, operating earnings, after
 restatement, were 9.7%, an improvement of 10.2 percentage points versus the
 first nine months of 1996.
