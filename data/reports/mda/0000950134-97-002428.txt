          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 OVERVIEW
 
          The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
 nationally branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding
 copy paper) in the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products
 industry. The Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing
 pads, file folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products.
 Through its Ampad division, the Company is among the largest and most important
 suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies,
 machine papers and retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing
 office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is
 the leading supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business
 envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its
 future operating results will not be directly comparable to its historical
 operating results because of its strategic acquisitions and the expected cost
 savings from integration of its acquisitions. The Company's business has not
 generally been seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may
 affect prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.
 
          Strategic Acquisitions. On October 31, 1995, the Company acquired
 Williamhouse, a leading supplier of envelopes to many of the largest and
 fastest growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price (including
 assumption of debt) of approximately $300 million plus reimbursement of certain
 expenses to the sellers. On June 28, 1996, the Company acquired Niagara, a
 national supplier of envelopes to fast growing distributors, for an aggregate
 purchase price of approximately $53.2 million, including costs of the
 acquisition and a $5 million one year consulting agreement with Niagara's
 former president. With these acquisitions, the Company became the largest
 supplier of envelopes to the national paper merchants. The Williamhouse
 acquisition was financed through the Company's old bank credit agreement and
 the assumption of senior subordinated notes. The Niagara acquisition was
 financed with proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division of Williamhouse.
 
          On July 5, 1994, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain
 liabilities of SCM, one of the industry leaders in hanging files and writing
 products. The aggregate acquisition consideration of $14.4 million, including
 fees and expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt. On August
 16, 1995, the Company acquired the file folder and hanging file product lines
 of Atapco's Globe-Weis office products division. Atapco was one of the leading
 providers of file folders and hanging files to office products superstores. The
 aggregate acquisition consideration of $19.9 million, including fees and
 expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt and seller notes.
 The SCM acquisition and the Globe-Weis acquisition further strengthened the
 Company's position in the filing supplies and writing products categories.
 
          On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired Shade/Allied, a national
 supplier of machine papers, principally continuous computer forms. The purchase
 price of $49.5 million was financed with borrowings under the Company's new
 bank credit agreement. The Company expects that Shade/Allied's products will be
 distributed by both the Ampad and Williamhouse divisions and that the
 manufacturing plants will be integrated into the Ampad division. This
 acquisition provided the Company with a more significant position in a fourth
 product category.
 
          Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been
 accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have
 currently affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of
 operations in certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs
 (including assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based
 on the fair market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase
 price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain
 
 
 
 
 
                                       30

 assets such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including
 goodwill, which results in incremental annual depreciation and amortization
 expense each year.
 
          Potential Operating Improvements. The Company has identified and is in
 the process of implementing cost reductions in connection with the
 acquisitions. In addition, management plans to implement further identified
 cost reductions which are expected to improve operations beyond 1996. The most
 significant cost reduction actions involve closing Williamhouse's New York City
 and Niagara's Buffalo headquarters, contractual changes in employee benefit and
 other insurance plans and the consolidation of sales and marketing and other
 administrative functions to eliminate duplicative functions, sales programs and
 sales personnel, and the consolidation and integration of manufacturing and
 distribution facilities. These improvements were being implemented during 1996
 and, except for the integration of certain manufacturing and distribution
 facilities, were completed by the end of 1996. However, because Williamhouse's
 and Niagara's selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were
 historically higher than the SG&A expenses of the Company. SG&A expenses as a
 percentage of net sales in 1996 were higher than the SG&A expenses to net sales
 percentage relationship in 1995 and 1994.
 
          Sale of Regency Division. The Company's management identified the
 Regency Division of Williamhouse as a nonstrategic asset following the
 acquisition of Williamhouse and, on June 27, 1996, sold the Regency Division
 for approximately $47.9 million in net proceeds. As a result, the financial
 statements of the Company included elsewhere herein reflect the Regency
 Division as "Assets Held for Sale" as of December 31, 1995. The Company used
 the net proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division to fund substantially
 all of the Niagara acquisition.
 
          Paper Prices. Paper represents a majority of the Company's cost of
 goods sold. While paper prices have increased by an average of less than 1%
 annually since 1989, certain commodity grades have shown considerable price
 volatility during that period. This volatility negatively impacted the
 Company's earnings in 1994, particularly in the fourth quarter, as a result of
 the Company's inability to implement price changes in many of its product lines
 without giving its customers advance notification. Beginning in January 1995,
 the Company adopted new pricing policies enabling it to set product prices
 consistent with the Company's cost of paper at the time of shipment. The
 Company believes that it is now able to price its products so as to minimize
 the impact of price volatility on dollar margins.
 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
          The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
 operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 1994,
 1995, and 1996. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1994
 reflect the historical results of the Company and the results of SCM for the
 period from July 5, 1994 through December 31, 1994. The results of operations
 for the year ended December 31, 1995 reflect the historical results of the
 Company, the results of Globe-Weis from August 18, 1995 through December 31,
 1995 and the results of Williamhouse for the two-month period ended December
 31, 1995. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1996
 include the results of operations of Niagara from June 28, 1996 through
 December 31, 1996.

 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
          Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $326.7
 million, or 127.0%, to $583.9 million from $257.2 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1995. Of this net sales increase, $274.8 million is related to the
 acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara and $35.2 million is related to the
 acquisition of Globe-Weis. Ampad division net sales increased by $16.7 million
 during 1996 compared to 1995 due to higher sales to the fast growing customer
 channels such as superstores, mass merchant stores and contract stationers.
 
          Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $77.9
 million, or 164.0%, to $125.4 million from $47.5 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1995. Approximately $69.5 million of the increase in gross profit
 is attributable to the acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara. Gross profit
 margin increased to 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 1996 from 18.5% for
 the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in gross profit margin is
 primarily attributable to higher margins of the Williamhouse division.
 
          SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased $29.6
 million, or 164.4%, to $47.6 million from $18.0 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1995. Approximately $20.2 million is attributable to the
 acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara and $3.6 million to amortization of
 goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisitions. The remainder of the
 increase is due primarily to costs associated with the support of a
 significantly larger corporation.
 
          Management fees and services increased $3.3 million in 1996 due to the
 amortization of a consulting agreement with a former shareholder of Niagara and
 an increase in Bain Capital's management fees.
 
          Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased $29.3
 million to $43.0 million from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31,
 1995. The increase is attributable primarily to higher levels of outstanding
 debt for a full year as a result of the acquisition of Williamhouse and
 Globe-Weis. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a
 reduction of approximately $3.4 million in interest expense following the
 redemption of $70 million of the Notes in August 1996.
 
          The income tax provision for year ended December 31, 1996 reflects an
 effective tax rate of 43.2% versus an effective tax benefit rate of 56.5% for
 the year ended December 31, 1995. The effective tax rate for 1996 reflects a
 40% combined statutory federal and state income tax rate adjusted for
 nondeductible expenses, primarily goodwill amortization. The effective tax rate
 for the year ended December 31, 1995 differs from the federal statutory income
 tax rate of 35% due to state income taxes and the reversal of a valuation
 allowance on deferred tax assets relating to the realizability of the Company's
 net operating loss carryforward.
 
          Extraordinary item represents an after tax loss on extinguishment of
 debt of $20.0 million ($33.0 million pretax) recognized as a result of the
 redemption of $70.0 million of senior subordinated

 notes with a portion of the net proceeds from the initial public offering and
 the write off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related
 to the Notes and all of the deferred financing costs associated with the old
 bank credit agreement and the old accounts receivable facility.
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994
 
          Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased by $129.5
 million, or 101.4%, to $257.2 million from $127.7 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1994. Of this net sales increase, $45.8 million, or 35.4%, is
 related to the Williamhouse acquisition and $29.1 million, or 22.4%, is related
 to the Globe-Weis acquisition. The remaining increase of $54.6 million, or
 42.2%, is related to increased net sales in the base business, primarily as a
 result of price increases and, to a lesser extent, a change in product mix,
 partially offset by a decline in sales through non-strategic channels,
 particularly independent dealers. Net sales to independent dealers declined to
 less than 3.0% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 1995, compared to
 8.6% in 1994.
 
          Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased by $40.5
 million, or 579%, to $47.5 million, from $7.0 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1994. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase in gross profit
 is attributable to the Williamhouse acquisition and an estimated $3.8 million
 increase is due to the Globe-Weis acquisition. The remainder of the increase in
 gross profit is due to (i) higher variable margins associated with the gains in
 unit sales, product mix and pricing; (ii) lower fixed manufacturing costs
 primarily as a result of the SCM plant closure; (iii) the Company's ability to
 pass along paper price increases to its customers beginning in 1995, and (iv)
 lower LIFO charges of approximately $2.5 million in 1995. Fixed manufacturing
 costs as a percentage of net sales declined as a result of the successful
 integration of the Globe-Weis manufacturing operations and the closing of the
 Indiana facility.
 
          Gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 1995 to
 18.5% from 5.5% in 1994. The increase is principally a result of higher
 variable margins, lower fixed manufacturing costs and lower LIFO charges.
 Excluding acquisitions, gross profit margin would have increased to 16.4% for
 the period ended December 31, 1995.
 
          SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased by $8.0
 million, 80.0%, to $18.0 million, from $10.0 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1994. Approximately $5.9 million of this increase related to the
 acquisitions. The balance of such increase related to higher amortization costs
 as a result of the acquisitions and the costs associated with the accounts
 receivable facility.
 
          The non-recurring compensation charge of $27.6 million for the year
 ended December 31, 1995 was primarily the result of the issuance of options for
 preferred stock granted to existing option holders in order to maintain such
 holders' economic value in previously issued options for Common Stock as a
 result of the preferred stock dividend and the grant of additional options in
 December 1995 at an exercise price below the fair market value at the date of
 grant.
 
          Income (loss) from operations for the year ended December 31, 1995
 increased by $4.9 million to $1.3 million from ($3.6) million in 1994, for the
 reasons stated above. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net
 sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased to 0.6% from (2.8)% for
 the year ended December 31, 1994.
 
          Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased $9.1
 million, or 198%, to $13.7 million from $4.6 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1994. The increase is attributable primarily to increased
 borrowings as a result of the Williamhouse and the Globe-Weis acquisitions.

 <PAGE>   22
 
          Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 1995 reflects an
 effective tax rate of 56.5%, versus a 6.1% effective tax rate in 1994. The
 difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate in 1995 is due to
 a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from improved
 operating results.
 
          Extraordinary item represents an after tax loss on extinguishment of
 debt of $9.7 million ($16.2 million pretax) recognized as a result of $10.8
 million of redemption premiums and prepayment penalties associated with the
 repurchase of the old debentures and the Company's bank debt and the write off
 of $5.3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the
 redemption of the old debentures and the Company's debt refinancings.
 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
          Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31,
 1996 was $23.2 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of
 $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in cash
 provided by operating activities is primarily due to higher net sales and
 earnings of the Company in 1996. The net cash provided for the year ended
 December 31, 1995 resulted primarily from an increase of $5.0 million in
 accounts payable, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.9 million, a decrease
 in inventories and increased margins on sales. Cash used by operations for the
 years ended December 31, 1994 was $1.9 million. The use of cash for the year
 ended December 31, 1994 was primarily due to an increase in inventories offset
 by an increased LIFO charge due to rising paper prices, and a decrease in
 accrued expenses, offset by an increase in accounts payable.
 
          Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996
 and 1995 was $16.2 million and $131.3 million, respectively. The use of cash
 for the year ended December 31, 1996 was principally due to the Niagara
 acquisition ($53.0 million, net of cash received) and purchases of equipment
 ($14.6 million), offset by proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division and
 other assets held for sale ($49.3 million). The use of cash for the year ended
 December 31, 1995, was due to the Williamhouse acquisition ($122.7 million),
 the Globe-Weis acquisition ($7.0 million) and purchase of equipment ($3.9
 million). The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 1994, was due
 primarily to the SCM acquisition ($13.7 million).
 
          Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996
 was $23.0 million as compared to a cash provision from financing activities of
 $144.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. During the year ended
 December 31, 1996, the Company (i) completed its initial public offering of
 12.5 million shares of common stock for $172.8 million in net proceeds after
 deducting offering fees and expenses, (ii) refinanced its accounts receivable
 facility with a new $60.0 million facility, (iii) refinanced its bank credit
 agreement, (iv) redeemed $70.0 million of senior subordinated notes, (v) repaid
 $95.8 million of debt incurred under the old bank credit agreement, (vi) paid
 $7.7 million in redemption premiums on the Notes, (vii) repaid $10 million
 under the new accounts receivable facility with proceeds from the sale of the
 Regency Division, (viii) borrowed $54 million under the new accounts receivable
 facility and (ix) repaid WR seller notes for $25 million. Cash provided by
 financing activities for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $144.9
 million and $16.5 million, respectively, primarily due to periodic financings
 incurred in connection with the various acquisitions.
 
          Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, in the years ended
 December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $14.6 million, $3.9 million and $0.9
 million, respectively. The Company expects that combined capital expenditure
 requirements will be approximately $18 million for 1997. The Company believes
 these capital expenditure levels will be sufficient to maintain competitiveness
 and to provide sufficient manufacturing capacity. The Company expects to fund
 capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operating activities.

          Contemporaneously with the initial public offering, the Company
 refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the old bank credit
 agreement with the proceeds of the loans under the new bank credit agreement.
 As a result of the refinancing, effective July 8, 1996, the Company borrowed
 $162.0 million in revolving loans and $6.5 million in swingline loans. The
 proceeds of these loans were used to (i) pay off the remaining $145.0 million
 in term loans, $5.0 million in revolver loans and $7.7 million in swingline
 loans outstanding under the old bank credit agreement and (ii) pay
 approximately $8.1 million in fees associated with the new bank credit
 agreement. The new bank credit agreement provides a revolving credit facility
 of $300 million . As of December 31, 1996, the Company had $155 million
 available for borrowing under its bank credit agreement. Loans made under the
 new bank credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the
 Company's option, (i) a base rate plus an applicable margin or (ii) the LIBOR
 rate plus an applicable margin (as each term is defined in the new bank credit
 agreement). The applicable margin varies from 0% to 1.75%, based on the
 Company's level of debt as compared to earnings ("leverage ratio"). The
 Company's margin is currently 1.50%.
 
          Availability under the new bank credit agreement is subject to an
 unused commitment fee which, like the applicable margin, varies from 0.3% to
 0.5% based on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company's current rate is 0.5%.
 Availability under the new bank credit agreement will be reduced to the extent
 of the net proceeds of a sale of assets by the Company, the net proceeds of an
 issuance of debt by the Company or 50% of the net proceeds of an issuance of
 equity by the Company. Availability will also be reduced by $50 million in 1999
 and $50 million in 2000. The new bank credit agreement will terminate in 2001.
 The Company will be permitted to make acquisitions under the new bank credit
 agreement up to an aggregate of $25 million without consent of the agent bank
 and up to $50 million if, on a pro forma basis giving effect to such
 acquisition, the Company's leverage ratio is less than 3.0:1.0. As a result of
 the new bank credit agreement, the Company's effective interest rate under its
 senior credit facility was reduced by 189 basis points contemporaneously with
 the initial public offering. The bank credit agreement and the indenture impose
 certain restrictions on the Company, including restrictions on its ability to
 incur indebtedness, pay dividends, make investments, grant liens, sell its
 assets and engage in certain other activities. In addition, the indebtedness of
 the Company under the bank credit agreement is secured by substantially all of
 the assets of the Company, including the Company's real and personal property,
 inventory, accounts receivable, intellectual property and other intangibles.
 
          On May 29, 1996, the Company refinanced its $45 million accounts
 receivable facility with a new $60 million accounts receivable facility. Under
 the new facility the Company may sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided
 interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable. At December 31,
 1996, $54 million of accounts receivable were sold under the program. The
 agreement expires in 2000.
 
          On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired Shade/Allied for
 approximately $49.5 million, including acquisition costs, using proceeds from
 borrowings under its bank credit agreement.
 
          Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
 anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
 available sources of funds including borrowings under the new bank credit
 agreement and available cash on hand at December 31, 1996, will be adequate for
 the foreseeable future to make required payments of principal and interest on
 the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and
 working capital requirements and to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to
 comply with the terms of their debt agreements. However, actual capital
 requirements may change, particularly as a result of any acquisitions which the
 Company may make. The ability of the Company to meet its debt service
 obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent, however, upon the
 future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be
 subject to general economic conditions and to financial, business and other
 factors, including factors beyond the Company's control. A portion of the
 consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at floating rates; therefore,
 its financial condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in
 prevailing interest rates.

 The Company has entered into an interest rate protection agreement to minimize
 the impact from a rise in interest rates.
 
 INFLATION
 
          The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on 
 its results of operations for the three years ended December 31,
 1996.
 
 CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
          This report contains certain forward-looking statements (as such term
 is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) relating to
