 driven by the continuing severe downturn in the global economy.&#160;&#160;In addition, as a result of reduced demand, there has been substantial fare discounting across the industry, which has resulted in decreased passenger yield.&#160;&#160;Mainline passenger revenue decreased by $3.2 billion to $15.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008.&#160;&#160;Mainline passenger unit revenues decreased 11.1 percent in 2009 due to an 11.2 percent decrease in passenger yield compared to 2008 and
 partially offset by a load factor increase of approximately 0.1 points.&#160;&#160;Passenger yield remains low and well below the Company&#8217;s peak yield set in the year 2000, despite cumulative inflation of approximately 26 percent over the same time frame.&#160;&#160;The Company believes this is the result of a fragmented industry with numerous competitors and excess capacity, increased low cost carrier competition, increased price competition due to the internet, and other factors.&#160;&#160;Since deregulation
 in 1978, the Company&#8217;s passenger yield has increased 64 percent, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as measured by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, has grown by over 220 percent.&#160;&#160;The Company believes increases in passenger yield will continue to significantly lag CPI indefinitely.</font></div>

 in July 2008, they have steadily increased since the first quarter of 2009 and remain high and extremely volatile by historical standards.&#160;&#160;However, the Company&#8217;s unit costs excluding fuel and special charges were greater for the year ended December 31, 2009 than for the same period in 2008.&#160;&#160;Factors driving the increase include increased defined benefit pension expenses (due to the stock market decline in 2008), higher airport rent and landing fees and cost pressures associated with
 the Company&#8217;s capacity reductions announced in 2008 and 2009 and dependability initiatives.</font></div>

 the overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. It will be very difficult for the Company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially or if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended period at high levels.</font></div>

The decrease in operating expense was largely due to a year-over-year decrease in fuel prices from $3.03 per gallon in 2008 to $2.01 per gallon in 2009, including the impact of fuel hedging.&#160;&#160;Although fuel prices have abated considerably from the record high prices recorded in July 2008, they have steadily increased since the first quarter of 2009 and remain high and extremely volatile by historical standards. A return to the recent historically high fuel prices and/or disruptions in
 the supply of fuel would further materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s unit costs excluding fuel and special charges were greater for the year ended December 31, 2009 than the year ended December 31, 2008.&#160;&#160;Factors driving the increase include increased defined benefit pension expenses (due to the stock market decline in 2008), higher airport rent and landing fees and cost pressures associated with the Company&#8217;s
 capacity reductions announced in 2008 and 2009 and dependability initiatives.</font></div>
