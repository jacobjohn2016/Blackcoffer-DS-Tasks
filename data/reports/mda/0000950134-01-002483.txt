          FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982. AMR's
 principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American), was founded in 1934.
 AMR's operations fall almost entirely in the airline industry.
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 AMR's net earnings in 2000 were $813 million, or $5.43 per common share ($5.03
 diluted). AMR's income from continuing operations before extraordinary loss in
 2000 was $779 million, or $5.20 per common share ($4.81 diluted). The results
 for 2000 include the following special items: (i) a gain of $57 million ($36
 million after tax) from the sale of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5
 million shares of priceline.com Incorporated (priceline) common stock, (ii) a
 gain of approximately $41 million ($26 million after tax) from the recovery of
 start-up expenses from the Canadian Airlines International Limited (Canadian)
 services agreement, and (iii) a charge of $56 million ($35 million after tax)
 for the Company's employee home computer program.
 
        AMR's net earnings in 1999 were $985 million, or $6.46 per common share
 ($6.26 diluted). AMR's income from continuing operations in 1999 was $656
 million, or $4.30 per common share ($4.17 diluted). A labor disagreement that
 disrupted operations during the first quarter of 1999 negatively impacted the
 Company's 1999 results by an estimated $225 million ($140 million after tax).
 The results for 1999 also include the following: (i) American's December 1998
 acquisition of Reno Air, Inc. (Reno) and AMR Eagle's March 1999 acquisition of
 Business Express, Inc. (Business Express), (ii) a gain of $83 million ($64
 million after tax) on the sale of AMR Services, AMR Combs and TeleService
 Resources, which is included in discontinued operations, (iii) a gain of
 approximately $213 million ($118 million after taxes and minority interest)
 resulting from the sale of a portion of the Company's holding in Equant N.V.
 (Equant), of which approximately $75 million ($47 million after tax) is included
 in income from continuing operations, (iv) a gain of $40 million ($25 million
 after tax) from the Company's sale of its investment in the cumulative
 mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of Canadian and a $67 million
 tax benefit resulting from the tax loss on the Company's investment in Canadian,
 and (v) a charge of approximately $37 million ($25 million after tax) relating
 to the provision for certain litigation items.
 
 REVENUES
 
 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 The Company's revenues increased approximately $2.0
 billion, or 11.1 percent, versus 1999. American's passenger revenues increased
 by 11.4 percent, or $1.7 billion. American's yield (the average amount one
 passenger pays to fly one mile) of 14.05 cents increased by 7.1 percent compared
 to 1999. For the year, domestic yields increased 7.5 percent while European,
 Latin American and Pacific yields increased 9.9 percent, 4.2 percent and 3.8
 percent, respectively. The increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong
 U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel both domestically and
 internationally, a favorable pricing climate, the impact of a domestic fuel
 surcharge implemented in January 2000 and increased in September 2000, a labor
 disruption at one of the Company's competitors which positively impacted the
 Company's revenues by approximately $80 to $100 million, and a schedule
 disruption which negatively impacted the Company's operations in 1999.
 
        American's domestic traffic increased 2.7 percent to 78.5 billion revenue
 passenger miles (RPMs), while domestic capacity, as measured by available seat
 miles (ASMs), decreased 1.6 percent. The decrease in domestic capacity was due
 primarily to the Company's More Room Throughout Coach program. (The Company's
 More Room Throughout Coach program reconfigures American's entire fleet to
 increase the seat pitch from the present industry standard of 31 and 32 inches
 to a predominant seat pitch of 34 and 35 inches.) International traffic grew 6.8
 percent to 38.1 billion RPMs on capacity growth of 3.1 percent. The increase in
 international traffic was led by a 12.2 percent increase in the Pacific on
 capacity growth of 2.5 percent, an 8.5 percent increase in Europe on capacity
 growth of 6.7 percent, and a 4.1 percent increase in Latin America on capacity
 growth of 0.4 percent. In 2000, American derived approximately 70 percent of its
 passenger revenues from domestic operations and approximately 30 percent from
 international operations.

        AMR Eagle's passenger revenues increased $158 million, or 12.2 percent.
 AMR Eagle's traffic increased to 3.7 billion RPMs, up 10.7 percent, while
 capacity increased to 6.3 billion ASMs, or 10.9 percent. The increase in
 revenues was due primarily to growth in AMR Eagle capacity aided by a strong
 U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel, and a favorable pricing
 environment.
 
        Cargo revenues increased 12.1 percent, or $78 million, due primarily to a
 fuel surcharge implemented in February 2000 and increased in October 2000 and
 the increase in cargo capacity from the addition of 16 Boeing 777-200ER aircraft
 in 2000.
 
 1999 COMPARED TO 1998 The Company's revenues increased $214 million, or 1.2
 percent, versus 1998. American's passenger revenues increased by 0.1 percent, or
 $12 million. American's yield of 13.12 cents decreased by 2.7 percent compared
 to 1998. For the year, domestic yields decreased 1.1 percent, while European,
 Pacific and Latin American yields decreased 7.2 percent, 6.0 percent and 4.5
 percent, respectively. The decrease in domestic yield was due primarily to
 increased capacity, the labor disagreement during the first quarter of 1999, and
 the impact of international yield decreases on domestic yields. The decrease in
 international yields was due primarily to weak economies in certain parts of the
 world, large industry capacity additions and increased fare sale activity.
 
        American's domestic traffic increased 2.1 percent to 76.4 billion RPMs,
 while domestic capacity increased 4.1 percent. The increase in domestic traffic
 was due primarily to the addition of Reno. International traffic grew 4.6
 percent to 35.7 billion RPMs on a capacity increase of 3.1 percent. The increase
 in international traffic was led by a 44.2 percent increase in the Pacific on
 capacity growth of 44.1 percent and a 5.7 percent increase in Europe on capacity
 growth of 7.3 percent, partially offset by a 1.9 percent decrease in Latin
 America on a capacity decrease of 5.1 percent. In 1999, American derived
 approximately 70 percent of its passenger revenues from domestic operations and
 approximately 30 percent from international operations.
 
        AMR Eagle's passenger revenues increased $173 million, or 15.4 percent.
 AMR Eagle's traffic increased to 3.4 billion RPMs, up 20.9 percent, while
 capacity increased to 5.6 billion ASMs, or 26.1 percent, due primarily to the
 addition of Business Express in March 1999.
 
 OPERATING EXPENSES
 
 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 The Company's operating expenses increased 10.5 percent,
 or approximately $1.7 billion. American's cost per ASM increased by 10.5 percent
 to 10.38 cents, partially driven by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company's
 More Room Throughout Coach program. Adjusting for this program, American's cost
 per ASM grew approximately 7.2 percent. Wages, salaries and benefits increased
 $663 million, or 10.8 percent, primarily due to an increase in the average
 number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases
 that are built into the Company's labor contracts, an increase of approximately
 $93 million in the provision for profit-sharing, and a charge of approximately
 $56 million for the Company's employee home computer program. Aircraft fuel
 expense increased $799 million, or 47.1 percent, due to an increase of 42.0
 percent in the Company's average price per gallon and a 3.7 percent increase in
 the Company's fuel consumption. The increase in fuel expense is net of gains of
 approximately $545 million recognized during 2000 related to the Company's fuel
 hedging program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $110 million,
 or 10.1 percent, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft, many of which
 replaced older aircraft. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased
 $92 million, or 9.2 percent, due primarily to an increase in airframe and engine
 maintenance volumes at the Company's maintenance bases and an approximate $17
 million one-time credit the Company received in 1999. Commissions to agents
 decreased 10.8 percent, or $125 million, despite an 11.4 percent increase in
 passenger revenues, due primarily to commission structure changes implemented in
 October 1999 and January 2000, and a decrease in the percentage of
 commissionable transactions.

 <PAGE>   22
 
 1999 COMPARED TO 1998 The Company's operating expenses increased 6.7 percent, or
 approximately $1 billion. American's cost per ASM increased by 1.5 percent to
 9.39 cents. Wages, salaries and benefits increased $327 million, or 5.6 percent,
 primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees and
 contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the Company's
 labor contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for
 profit-sharing. Aircraft fuel expense increased $92 million, or 5.7 percent, due
 to a 5.5 percent increase in the Company's fuel consumption and a 0.2 percent
 increase in the Company's average price per gallon. The increase in fuel expense
 is net of gains of approximately $111 million recognized during 1999 related to
 the Company's fuel hedging program. Depreciation and amortization expense
 increased $52 million, or 5.0 percent, due primarily to the addition of new
 aircraft, partially offset by the change in depreciable lives and residual
 values for certain types of aircraft in 1999 (see Note 1 to the consolidated
 financial statements). Maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased 7.3
 percent, or $68 million, due primarily to the addition of Reno and Business
 Express aircraft during 1999. Commissions to agents decreased 5.2 percent, or
 $64 million, despite a 1.2 percent increase in passenger revenues, due to the
 benefit from the changes in the international commission structure in late 1998
 and the base commission structure in October 1999, and a decrease in the
 percentage of commissionable transactions. Other rentals and landing fees
 increased 12.3 percent, or $103 million, due primarily to higher facilities rent
 and landing fees across American's system and the addition of Reno and Business
 Express. Food service increased $65 million, or 9.6 percent, due primarily to
 rate increases and the addition of Reno. Aircraft rentals increased $61 million,
 up 10.7 percent, primarily due to the addition of Reno and Business Express
 aircraft. Other operating expenses increased $342 million, or 12.0 percent, due
 primarily to increases in outsourced services, travel and incidental costs and
 booking fees.
 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)
 
 Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interest
 capitalized and miscellaneous - net.
 
 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Interest income increased $59 million, or 62.1 percent,
 due primarily to higher investment balances. Interest expense increased $74
 million, or 18.8 percent, resulting primarily from financing new aircraft
 deliveries. Interest capitalized increased 28.0 percent, or $33 million, due to
 an increase in purchase deposits for flight equipment. Miscellaneous - net
 increased $38 million due primarily to a $57 million gain on the sale of the
 Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock in
 the second quarter of 2000 and a gain of approximately $41 million from the
 recovery of start-up expenses from the Canadian services agreement. During 1999,
 the Company recorded a gain of approximately $75 million from the sale of a
 portion of American's interest in Equant and a gain of approximately $40 million
 related to the sale of the Company's investment in the preferred stock of
 Canadian. These gains were partially offset by the provision for the settlement
 of litigation items and the write-down of certain investments held by the
 Company during 1999.
 
 1999 COMPARED TO 1998 Interest income decreased $38 million, or 28.6 percent,
 due primarily to lower investment balances throughout most of 1999. Interest
 expense increased $21 million, or 5.6 percent, resulting primarily from an
 increase in long-term debt. Interest capitalized increased 13.5 percent, or $14
 million, due to an increase in purchase deposits for flight equipment throughout
 most of 1999. Miscellaneous - net increased $50 million due primarily to the
 sale of a portion of American's interest in Equant in 1999, which resulted in an
 approximate $75 million gain, and a gain of approximately $40 million from the
 sale of the Company's investment in the preferred stock of Canadian. These gains
 were partially offset by the provision for the settlement of litigation items
 and the write-down of certain investments held by the Company during 1999.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Operating activities provided net cash of $3.1 billion in 2000, $2.3 billion in
 1999 and $2.8 billion in 1998. The $878 million increase from 1999 to 2000
 resulted primarily from a decrease in working capital.
 
        Capital expenditures in 2000 totaled $3.7 billion, compared to $3.5
 billion in 1999 and $2.3 billion in 1998, and included aircraft acquisitions of
 approximately $3.1 billion. In 2000, American took delivery of 27 Boeing
 737-800s and 16 Boeing 777-200ERs. AMR Eagle took delivery of 24 Embraer 135
 aircraft and five Embraer 145 aircraft. These expenditures, as well as the
 expansion of certain airport facilities, were funded primarily with internally
 generated cash and the $559 million cash dividend from Sabre Holdings
 Corporation, except for (i) 11 Boeing aircraft which were financed through
 secured mortgage agreements, and (ii) the Embraer aircraft acquisitions which
 were funded through secured debt agreements.
 
        At December 31, 2000, the Company had commitments to acquire the
 following aircraft: 66 Boeing 737-800s, 23 Boeing 757-200s, 20 Boeing
 777-200ERs, 146 Embraer regional jets and 25 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries of
 all aircraft extend through 2006. Future payments for all aircraft, including
 the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $2.7 billion in
 2001, $1.6 billion in 2002, $900 million in 2003 and an aggregate of
 approximately $1.3 billion in 2004 through 2006. In addition to these
 commitments for aircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately $1.0
 billion in 2001 for modifications to aircraft, renovations of - and additions to
 - - airport and off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various other
 equipment and assets, of which approximately $855 million has been authorized by
 the Company's Board of Directors. The Company expects to fund its 2001 capital
 expenditures from the Company's existing cash and short-term investments,
 internally generated cash or new financing depending upon market conditions
 and the Company's evolving view of its long-term needs.

        On January 10, 2001, the Company announced three transactions that are
 expected to substantially increase the scope of its existing network. First, the
 Company announced that it had agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets
 of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA) for approximately $500 million in cash and
 to assume approximately $3.5 billion of TWA's obligations. The Company's
 agreement with TWA contemplated that TWA would file for bankruptcy protection
 under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and conduct an auction of its
 assets under the auspices of the Bankruptcy Court. During the auction, other
 credible offers would compete with the Company's offer. TWA filed for bankruptcy
 protection on January 10, 2001. In conjunction therewith, the Company also
 agreed to provide TWA with up to $200 million in debtor-in-possession financing
 to facilitate TWA's ability to maintain its operations until the completion of
 this transaction. The amount available under this facility was later increased
 to $330 million. As of March 19, 2001, approximately $289 million had been
 provided via the debtor-in-possession financing.
 
        The auction of TWA's assets was commenced on March 5, 2001, and recessed
 to March 7, 2001. During the recess, the Company increased its cash bid to $625
 million and agreed to leave in the TWA estate certain aircraft security
 deposits, advance rental payments and rental rebates that were estimated to
 bring approximately $117 million of value to TWA. The Company expects that the
 increase in the Company's bid will be more than offset, however, by the benefit
 to the Company of the reductions in rental rates the Company has negotiated with
 TWA's aircraft lessors. On March 7, 2001, TWA's board selected the
 Company's bid as the "highest and best" offer, and on March 12, 2001, the U.S.
 Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, entered an order approving the sale of
 TWA's assets to the Company. Consummation of the transaction is subject to
 several contingencies, including the waiver by TWA's unions of certain
 provisions of their collective bargaining agreements. The approval of the U.S.
 Department of Justice was obtained on March 16, 2001. Certain parties have
 filed appeals of the Bankruptcy Court's sale order, and have sought a stay of
 the transaction, pending the appeals. A provision of the Bankruptcy Code will
 permit the Company to close the transaction, despite pending appeals, unless a
 stay is granted. If a stay is granted, the Company would anticipate that the
 appeal process would be expedited. Upon the closing of the transaction, TWA will
 be integrated into American's operations with a continued hub operation in St.
 Louis. The Company expects to fund the acquisition of TWA's assets with its
 existing cash or short-term investments, internally generated cash or new
 financing depending on market conditions and the Company's evolving view of its
 long-term needs.
 
        Secondly, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire from United
 Airlines, Inc. (United) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)
 of US Airways, Inc. (US Airways) upon the consummation of the previously
 announced merger between United and US Airways. In addition to the acquisition
 of these assets, American will lease a number of slots and gates from United so
 that American may operate half of the northeast Shuttle (New York/Washington
 DC/Boston). United will operate the other half of the Shuttle. For these assets,
 American will pay approximately $1.2 billion in cash to United and assume
 approximately $300 million in aircraft operating leases. The consummation of
 these transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed United/US
 Airways merger. Also, the acquisition of aircraft is generally dependent upon a
 certain number of US Airways' Boeing 757 cockpit crew members transferring to
 American's payroll.
 
        Finally, American has agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to
 enter into an exclusive marketing agreement with, DC Air LLC (DC Air). American
 has agreed to pay $82 million in cash for its ownership stake. American will
 have a right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent
 stake in DC Air. American will also lease to DC Air a certain number of Fokker
 100 aircraft with necessary crews (known in the industry as a "wet lease").
 These wet leased aircraft will be used by DC Air in its operations. DC Air is
 the first significant new entrant at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
 (DCA) in over a decade. DC Air will acquire the assets needed to begin its DCA
 operations from United/US Airways upon the consummation of the merger between
 the two carriers. American's investment in DC Air and the other arrangements
 described above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger between
 United and US Airways.
 
        American has $1.0 billion in credit facility agreements that expire
 December 15, 2005, subject to certain conditions. At American's option, interest
 on these agreements can be calculated on one of several different bases. For
 most borrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon
 the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2000, no borrowings
 were outstanding under these agreements.

 <PAGE>   25
 
 
        AMR (principally American Airlines) historically operates with a working
 capital deficit as do most other airline companies. The existence of such a
 deficit has not in the past impaired the Company's ability to meet its
 obligations as they become due and is not expected to do so in the future.
 
 OTHER INFORMATION
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential
 liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airport
 locations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liability
 is joint and several. AMR's alleged volumetric contributions at these sites are
 minimal compared to others. AMR does not expect these matters, individually or
 collectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial
 position or liquidity. Additional information is included in Note 3 to the
 consolidated financial statements.
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
 and Hedging Activities", as amended (SFAS 133), was adopted by the Company on
 January 1, 2001. SFAS 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on
 the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be
 adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending
 on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either
 be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
 firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income
 until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
 derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
 The adoption of SFAS 133 did not have a material impact on the Company's net
 earnings. However, the Company recorded a transition adjustment of approximately
 $100 million in accumulated other comprehensive income in the first quarter of
 2001.
 
 OUTLOOK FOR 2001
 
 The Company is cautious in its outlook for 2001. On the revenue front, the
 primary concern is a slowing U.S. economy. American's strong revenue performance
 the past several years was marked by a growing U.S. economy coupled with a
 modest increase in industry capacity. Our revenue performance in 2001 will be
 dictated by how well the industry manages that relationship going forward.
 
        Absent the TWA, United/US Airways and DC Air transactions, American's
 capacity in 2001 is expected to grow about three percent, slightly less than the
 industry average. AMR Eagle's capacity will grow about 11 percent, reflecting
 the delivery of 31 new regional jets (RJs). Should the demand for air travel
 slow more quickly than expected, both carriers have the flexibility to further
 accelerate the retirement of certain older aircraft to keep the Company's
 capacity growth in line with general economic conditions.
 
        With the transactions, if approved, the Company expects to strengthen its
 position in several key domestic markets. The TWA transaction will provide
 American with a hub operation in St. Louis which will serve to strengthen the
 Company's position as an east/west carrier. In addition, these proposed
 transactions will allow the Company to gain additional slots and real estate at
 New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia airports, Washington Reagan, Boston and other
 major airports across the domestic system. At the same time, the Company will
 continue to improve the regional airline feed to American by strengthening AMR
 Eagle with the replacement of turboprop aircraft with RJs and the expansion of
 connecting service at Chicago O'Hare, DFW and key East Coast cities. The Company
 has reached agreements with three regional carriers feeding TWA in St. Louis.
 These agreements will provide for continued feed traffic from St. Louis should
 the TWA transaction be approved.
 
        On the international front, the Company will continue to pursue its
 relationship with Swissair/Sabena, and its bilateral agreement with EVA of
 Taiwan -- coupled with the Company's existing Asian carrier alliances -- will
 allow the Company to strengthen its presence in several Asian markets. The
 Company is also working to make the ONEworld alliance pay off in more
 significant ways, in part by strengthening its relationship with British
 Airways.

        Pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the volatility of fuel
 prices makes any prediction of overall costs very difficult. Excluding fuel
 expense and the impact of the Company's More Room Throughout Coach program, the
 Company anticipates an increase in unit cost of one to two percent driven
 primarily by higher labor and aircraft ownership costs. On the labor front, the
 Company has or will have all three of its union contracts open for negotiation
 in 2001. The expected result is upward pressure on labor rates. Aircraft
 depreciation and maintenance, materials and repairs expense will also be up,
 reflecting 2000 and 2001 aircraft deliveries. Other expense lines will see
 volume-driven increases and inflationary pressures. Partially offsetting these
 expected increases, the Company anticipates future reductions in distribution
 costs due to reduced commission expense and increased penetration rates for
 electronic tickets. And although oil prices are largely expected to decrease in
 2001 as compared to 2000 levels, the resulting benefit will be offset by lower
 fuel hedging gains in 2001 from the Company's fuel hedging program.
 
        Lastly, as a result of the proposed TWA, United/US Airways and DC Air
 transactions, and for several other reasons, American and American Eagle have
 initiated an impairment review of certain fleet types in accordance with
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."
 This review could result in an impairment charge to be taken by the Company in
 2001. The size of any resulting 2001 charge is not presently known, but may be
 significant.
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
 
 The preceding discussions under Business, Properties, Legal Proceedings and
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning of
 Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the Company's
 expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document and
 in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words "expects," "plans,"
 "anticipates," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
 statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, expectations
 as to results of operations and financial condition, including changes in
 capacity, revenues and costs, expectations as to future financing needs, overall
 economic projections and the Company's plans and objectives for future
 operations, including its ability to successfully integrate into its operations
 assets the Company may acquire in its previously announced transactions with
 TWA, United/US Airways and DC Air, and plans to develop future code-sharing
 programs and to evaluate new alliances. All forward-looking statements in this
 report are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this
 report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any
 forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events
 or otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors that
 could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The
 following factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could cause
 the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
 forward-looking statements:
 
 UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND EVENTS The Company's
 operations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reach
 agreement with any labor union representing the Company's employees or by an
 agreement with a labor union representing the Company's employees that contains
 terms which prevent the Company from competing effectively with other airlines.
 In addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outside
 the confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact the
 Company's operations.
 
 ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS The airline industry is affected by changes in
 international, national, regional and local economic conditions, inflation, war
 or political instability (or the threat thereof), consumer preferences and
 spending patterns, demographic trends, disruptions to the air traffic control
 system, consumer perceptions of airline safety, costs of safety, security and
 environmental measures, and the weather.
 
 COMMODITY PRICES Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, in the
 event of any increase in the price of jet fuel, there can be no assurance that
 the Company would be able to pass on increased fuel prices to its customers by
 increasing fares.

 COMPETITION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY Service over almost all of the Company's
 routes is highly competitive. The Company faces vigorous competition from major
 domestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign
 carriers, low-cost carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments, ground
 transportation. Pricing decisions are affected by competition from other
 airlines. Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect
 on the Company's financial results because American is generally required to
 match competitors' fares to maintain passenger traffic. No assurance can be
 given that any future fare reduction would be offset by increases in passenger
 traffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of traffic that would
 improve yields.
 
 CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGY Although it has no current plan to do so, the Company
 may change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue some of the
 goals stated herein.
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION Future results of the Company's operations may vary based
 upon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over the
 Company's operations may take, including the granting and timing of certain
 governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for
 code-sharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictions
 on competitive practices (e.g., Court Orders, or Agency regulations or orders,
 that would curtail an airline's ability to respond to a competitor), the
 adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards, and the adoption
 of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.
 
 UNCERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Company's current international
 activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as
 reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,
 currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international government
 regulation of the Company's operations.
 
 INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION The Company has announced a series of transactions with
 TWA, United/US Airways and DC Air (see page 23). These transactions are subject
 to a number of conditions and there can be no assurance that they will occur as
 planned. If these transactions do not occur and yet other U.S. carriers merge or
 create or expand marketing alliances, such mergers or new or expanded marketing
 alliances could adversely affect the Company.
