 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
 30, 1998
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales.  Total rental
 revenue increased by $44.1 million to $643.0 million for the six
 months ended September 30, 1999.  Net revenues from the rental of
 moving related equipment increased by $41.6 million.  This increase is
 primarily attributable to higher truck rental revenues.  The growth in
 truck rental revenue primarily reflects improved utilization and an
 increase in the average revenue per transaction.
 
      Net sales revenues were $110.1 million and $107.6 million for the
 six months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Revenue
 growth from the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.), which
 was up by 4.0% during the six months ended September 30, 1999, led to
 the improvement.
 
      Cost of sales was $62.7 million for the six months ended
 September 30, 1999, which represents a marginal decrease from $62.9
 million for the same period of the prior year.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations increased to
 $476.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 1999 from $459.9
 million for the six months ended September 30, 1998. Increased
 expenditure levels for rental equipment maintenance and personnel due
 to an increase in fleet size and inventory levels were primarily
 responsible.
 
      Lease expense was $63.6 million and $56.4 million for the six
 months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This increase
 reflects additional leasing activity over the past twelve months.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the six months ended September 30,
 1999 was $34.0 million, as compared to $26.3 million in the same
 period of the prior year.  The increase reflects an increase in
 depreciation recognized on the rental truck fleet.

 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $36.5 million
 for the six months ended September 30, 1999, compared to $37.3 million
 for the six months ended September 30, 1998.  Intercompany revenue was
 $35.3 million and $36.2 million for the six months ended September 30,
 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $4.7 million for the six
 months ended September 30, 1999 as compared to $1.4 million during the
 same period of the prior year.  This increase correlates to a
 significant increase in average note and mortgage receivables
 outstanding.
 
      Operating expenses were $1.9 million for the six months ended
 September 30, 1999 versus $3.0 million for the six months ended
 September 30, 1998.  Reduced building maintenance expense accounted
 for the majority of the decline from the prior year.
 
      Lease expense for the six months ended September 30, 1999 and
 1998 was $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  The increase
 reflects payments under a synthetic lease facility being utilized to
 develop storage properties.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the six months ended September 30,
 1999 was $4.6 million, as compared to $5.6 million in the same period
 of the prior year. The decrease reflects higher gains from the
 disposition of property and lower levels of depreciable assets.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Republic's premiums were $64.6 million and $65.3 million for the
 six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease
 in premium for 1999 as compared to 1998 resulted from the U-Haul
 Liability programs in the rental industry, which decreased to $23.9
 million from $28.8 million, respectively.  This decrease results from
 the restructuring of the U-Haul Business Auto General Liability
 policy.  The deductible was changed at April 1, 1999 from a flat
 deductible to a 95% deductible.   This reduced premiums by $3.5 million
 for the six months ended June 30, 1999 as compared to 1998.  The
 impact of this change will result in an overall savings of $0.6
 million in premium taxes for policy year 1999.  Additionally, assumed
 treaty reinsurance decreased to $20.9 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 1999 as compared to $23.5 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 1998 due to the 1998 Crop Hail premium accrued at
 December 1998.  Premiums for these programs are accrued during the
 fourth quarter and are settled in the first quarter of the following
 year.  Direct multiple peril and general agency premium increased to
 $11.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively, for the six months ended
 June 30, 1999 compared to $9.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively,
 for the six months ended June 30, 1998.
 
      Net investment income was $16.3 million and $18.2 million for the
 six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease
 from 1998 to 1999 is attributable to a decrease in invested assets and
 a lower yield on reinvested funds.
 
      Benefits and losses were $53.7 million and $56.5 million for the
 six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease
 from 1998 to 1999 resulted from a decrease in the U-Haul Liability
 programs for unpaid reported claims corresponding to the decrease in
 premiums mentioned above.
 
      Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) consists of commissions and
 other costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the
 production of new business.  The prior year end commissions, and other
 related expenses, are amortized over the following year.  The
 amortization expenses for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998
 consisted of $6.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively.  The
 increase from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to Republic's subsidiary
 company's DAC expense, which increased to $1.9 million for the six
 months ended June 30, 1999 from a negligible amount for the six months
 ended June 30, 1998.  Also contributing was a $1.5 million increase in
 the nonaffiliated agents' expense.  Field Underwriters increased due
 to 1998 written and unearned premiums and Republic Western Specialty
 Underwriters increased due to 1998 commission expenses relating to a
 settlement agreement with the previous general agent.  Additionally,
 1999 assumed treaty reinsurance increased $0.9 million due to increased
 1998 premium writings.
 <PAGE> 23
      Operating expenses were $15.4 million and $18.0 million for the
 six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Commissions
 decreased to $8.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999
 compared to $11.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 1998.
 This is mainly attributable to Republic's subsidiary's DAC earned for
 the six months ended June 30, 1999.  No DAC for this subsidiary was
 included for the six months ended June 30, 1998, as the subsidiary was
 purchased in December 1998.  Additionally, there was an increase in
 the nonaffiliated agents' DAC expense mentioned above.  Slightly
 offsetting were increased lease expenses of $0.9 million for the six
 months ended June 30, 1999 from $0.4 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 1998.  All other underwriting expenses consisted of $6.0
 million and $6.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $5.0
 million and $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  This represents a decrease in 1999 of $1.5
 million over 1998 and resulted mainly from decreased premium revenue
 and investment income and increased underwriting expenses.  Republic's
 operating profit remains on plan to meet year end expectations.
 
 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $47.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
 1999 and $36.3 million for 1998.  Oxford realized premium increases
 in the areas of Medicare supplement, credit life and disability, and single
 premium whole life insurance products.  Oxford increased Medicare supplement
 premium through the reinsurance of a block of policies and by adding direct
 premium through new programs; these increased premiums by $12.4 million.
 Credit life and disability premiums grew $2.7 million from increased marketing
 efforts.  Both Oxford's recently acquired companies, North American Insurance
 Company (NAI) and Safe Mate Life Insurance Company (Safe Mate), heavily market
 credit life and disability insurance.  Oxford began marketing a new single
 premium whole life policy in 1998; this product accounted for $2.4 million of
 new premiums.  As expected, premiums decreased due to fewer annuitizations,
 the termination of non-essential NAI lines and the sale of North American Fire
 & Casualty Insurance Company at the end of 1998 to Republic.  These changes
 accounted for a $6.6 million decrease in premiums through the first six months
 of 1999.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $10.1
 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and $9.4 million for
 1998.  This increase is due to the increase in the average invested
 assets for the year, which was the result of new premium in 1999 and
 the increased asset base from the acquisition of NAI and Safe Mate.
 
      Benefits incurred were $30.3 million and $23.5 million for
 the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This
 increase is primarily due to Medicare supplement benefits incurred.
 These benefits are related to the new business recorded in 1998.  The
 new Medicare supplement reinsurance accounted for $8.9 million of
 benefit variance.  Oxford has experienced improved loss ratios in its
 credit insurance products, partially offsetting the new Medicare
 supplement benefits.
 
      Amortization of DAC was $9.6 million and $6.4 million for the six
 months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Typically, Oxford
 defers commissions and other policy acquisition costs on single
 premium business.  These costs are amortized as the premium is earned
 over the term of the policy.  Oxford continues to increase its single
 premium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferred
 costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization.
 
      Operating expenses were $11.0 million and $9.1 million for the
 six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  A key
 component of operating expenses is the amortization of acquisition
 costs resulting from the purchase of NAI.  This amounts to $1.7
 million in 1999.  Commissions have increased $2.0 million in 1999 in
 proportion to the increase in new premiums.  Operating expenses, still
 within budgeted expectations, have increased in 1999 due to the
 expansion of business volume.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was
 $6.5 million and $6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease over the prior year is primarily
 due to increased health loss ratios.  This negative trend is being
 corrected through statutory premium rate filings.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $39.8 million for the six months ended
 September 30, 1999, as compared to $36.6 million for the six months
 ended September 30, 1998.  The increase can be attributed to an
 increase in average debt outstanding and a modest increase in the
 average cost of debt.
 <PAGE> 24
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings of $130.8 million
 were realized in the six months ended September 30, 1999, as compared
 to $112.6 million for the same period in 1998.  After providing for
 income taxes, net earnings for the six months ended September 30, 1999
 were $84.4 million, as compared to $73.4 million for the same period
 of the prior year.
 
 
 QUARTERLY RESULTS
      The following table presents unaudited quarterly results for the
 ten quarters in the period beginning April 1, 1997 and ending
 September 30, 1999.  AMERCO believes that all necessary adjustments
 have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly, and
 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, its results.
 U-Haul moving and storage operations are seasonal and proportionally more of
 AMERCO's revenues and net earnings from its U-Haul moving and storage
 operations are generated in the first and second quarters of each
 fiscal year (April through September).  The operating results for the
 periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for any
 future period.

 QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 VERSUS QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales.  Rental
 revenue increased by $20.0 million to $337.5 million in the quarter
 ended September 30, 1999.  This increase reflects an $18.4 million
 increase in revenues from the rental of moving related equipment
 reflecting improved local truck utilization, higher average revenue
 per transaction and higher truck rental inventory.
 
      Net sales revenues were $52.5 million in the quarter ended
 September 30, 1999 as compared to net sales of $51.3 million in the
 quarter ended September 30, 1998.  Revenue growth from the sale of
 moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.) and hitches led to the
 majority of the increase during the quarter.
 
      Cost of sales was $31.4 million in the quarter ended September
 30, 1999, which represents an increase from $30.2 million for the same
 period of the prior year.  Rising material costs from the sale of
 propane accounted from almost half of the increase.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany elimination increased to
 $250.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 1999 from $242.0
 million in the quarter ended September 30, 1998.  The increase
 reflects higher personnel and rental equipment maintenance
 expenditures associated with an increase in truck rental transactions
 and inventory levels.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the quarter ended September 30, 1999
 was $17.2 million, as compared to $12.2 million in the same period of
 the prior year.  The increase reflects an increase in depreciation
 recognized on the rental truck fleet.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $18.3 million
 in the quarter ended September 30, 1999, compared to $18.6 million in
 the quarter ended September 30, 1998.  Intercompany revenue was $17.7
 million as compared to $18.1 million in the prior year's first
 quarter.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $2.4 million in the
 quarter ended September 30, 1999 as compared to $0.5 million in the
 quarter ended September 30, 1998.  This increase correlates to a
 significant increase in average note and mortgage receivables
 outstanding.
 
      Operating expenses were $1.4 million in the quarter ended
 September 30, 1999 versus $1.5 million in the quarter ended September
 30, 1998.  Reduced building maintenance expense accounted for the
 majority of the decline from the prior year.
 
      Lease expense was $0.6 million during the quarter ended September
 30, 1999 versus a negligible amount during quarter ended September 30,
 1998.  The increase reflects payments under a synthetic lease facility
 being utilized to develop storage properties.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the quarter ended September 30, 1999
 was $2.6 million, as compared to $2.1 million in the same period of
 the prior year.  The increase reflects lower gains from the disposition
 of property.
 <PAGE> 27
 Property and Casualty
      Republic's premiums for the quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998
 were $30.8 million and $42.5 million, respectively.  The premium
 decrease in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from the U-Haul Liability
 programs in the rental industry, which decreased to $9.4 million from
 $23.0 million, respectively.  This decrease results from the
 restructuring of the U-Haul Business Auto General Liability policy.
 The deductible was changed at April 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to
 a 95% deductible.  This reduced premiums by $12.5 million for the
 quarter ended June 30, 1999 as compared to 1998.  The result of this
 change will result in an overall savings of $0.6 million in premium
 taxes for policy year 1999.  Additionally, assumed treaty reinsurance
 decreased to $11.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 as
 compared to $13.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1998 due to a
 decrease in writings as a result of canceled treaties not replaced in
 1999.  Direct multiple peril and general agency premiums increased to
 $6.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively for the quarter ended June
 30, 1999 compared to $4.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively for
 the quarter ended June 30, 1998.
 
      Net investment income was $8.2 million and $9.2 million for the
 quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease from
 1998 to 1999 resulted from a decrease in invested assets and a lower
 yield on reinvested funds.
 
      Benefits and losses incurred were $25.4 million and $36.5 million
 for the quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease from 1998 to 1999 is due to a decrease in the U-Haul
 Liability programs for unpaid unreported claims corresponding to the
 decrease in premiums mentioned above.
 
      DAC consists of commissions and other costs, which vary with and
 are primarily related to the production of new business.  The prior
 year end commissions, and other related expenses, are amortized over
 the following year.  The amortization expenses for the quarters ended
 June 30, 1999 and 1998 consisted of $3.6 million and $0.6 million,
 respectively.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 is mainly due to
 Republic's subsidiary company's DAC expenses, which increased to $1.1
 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 from  a negligible amount
 for the quarter ended June 30, 1998.  Also contributing was a $1.0
 million increase in the nonaffiliated agents' expense.  Field
 Underwriting increased due to increased 1998 written and unearned
 premiums and Republic Western Specialty Underwriters increased due to
 1998 commission expenses relating to a settlement agreement with the
 previous general agent.  Additionally, 1999 assumed treaty reinsurance
 increased $0.7 million from 1998 due to increased 1998 premium
 writings.
 
      Operating expenses were $6.9 million and $10.4 million for the
 quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Commissions
 decreased to $4.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1999,
 compared to $7.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1998.  This is
 mainly attributable to Republic's subsidiary's DAC earned for the
 quarter ended June 30, 1999.  Since this subsidiary was purchased in
 December 1998, there was no DAC included for the quarter ended June
 30, 1998.  Additionally, there was an increase in the nonaffiliated
 agents' and assumed treaty reinsurance DAC which relates to the
 increase in the expense mentioned above.  Slightly offsetting were
 increased lease expenses of $0.5 million for the quarter ended June
 30, 1999 as compared to $0.2 million for the quarter ended June 30,
 1998.  All other underwriting expenses consisted of $2.0 million and
 $3.1 million for the quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $3.0
 million and $4.3 million for the quarters ended June 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  This represents a decrease in 1999 of $1.3
 million over 1998 and resulted mainly from decreased premium revenue
 and investment income, offset slightly by decreased underwriting
 expenses.

 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $22.1 million for the quarter ended June 30,
 1999 and $20.3 million for 1998. Oxford realized premium increases
 in the areas of Medicare supplement, credit life and disability and single
 premium whole life insurance products.  In 1999, Oxford increased premium
 over 1998 Medicare supplement premium through the reinsurance of a block of
 policies and by adding direct premium through new programs; these increased
 premiums by $2.2 million.  Credit life and disability premiums remained
 constant with production gains being offset by new ceding activities.
 Production sales of Oxford's new single premium whole life policy increased
 by $0.9 million in the second quarter compared to 1998.  These increases were
 offset by fewer reinsurance annuitizations in 1999 than 1998, leading
 to $0.8 million less in annuity premium.  In addition, there were $0.5
 million in premium decreases for the second quarter resulting from the
 planned termination of NAI products not part of Oxford's strategic
 focus.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $4.6
 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 and $5.0 million for 1998.
 This decrease is due to lower rates on short-term invested assets for
 the quarter.  Mortgage loan interest income dropped as the portfolio
 decreased.
 
      Benefits incurred were $14.9 million and $12.3 million for
 the quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This
 increase is primarily due to Medicare supplement benefits incurred.
 These benefits are related to the new business recorded during the
 last quarter of 1998.  The new Medicare supplement reinsurance
 accounted for $4.3 million of the increase.  Annuity benefits
 decreased $1.0 million in the period due to the decrease in
 annuitizations in 1999 over 1998.
 
      Amortization of DAC was $6.3 million and $3.6 million for the
 quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Typically,
 Oxford defers commissions and other policy acquisition costs on single
 premium business.  These costs are amortized as the premium is earned
 over the term of the policy.  Oxford continues to increase its single
 premium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferred
 costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization.
 
      Operating expenses were $2.9 million and $6.4 million for the
 quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  From 1998, the
 dynamic amortization of the purchase value of the policies acquired in
 the Encore Financial, Inc. purchase has decreased in relation to the
 short-term nature of the business that was in force.  Commissions have
 increased $1.1 million in 1999 in proportion to the increase in new
 premiums.  Compared to the second quarter in 1998, operating expenses
 increased for the quarter by $1.1 million stemming from the
 administration costs associated with new reinsurance contracts.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was
 $2.6 million and $3.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  The decrease over prior year is primarily due to
 higher loss ratios for the health products.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $19.6 million for the quarter ended
 September 30, 1999, as compared to $18.0 million for the quarter ended
 September 30, 1998.  The increase can be attributed to an increase in
 average debt outstanding and a modest increase in the average cost of
 debt.
 
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings were $65.4 million
 during the quarter ended September 30, 1999, as compared to $65.3
 million for the same period in 1998.  After providing for income
 taxes, net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 were
 $42.1 million, as compared to $42.2 million for the same period of the
 prior year.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain a large
 inventory of fixed asset rental items.  At September 30, 1999, net
 property, plant, and equipment represented approximately 62.6% of
 total assets from non-insurance operations and approximately 42.2% of
 consolidated assets.  In the six months ended September 30, 1999,
 capital expenditures were $182.7 million, as compared to $190.0
 million in the six months ended September 30, 1998.  These
 expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck
 fleet.  The capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained
 through internally generated funds from operations and through lease
 financings.
 
      Cash flow from operations was $149.2 million in the six months
 ended September 30, 1999, as compared to $100.1 million in the six
 months ended September 30, 1998.  The increase results from a
 combination of earnings growth, higher levels of depreciation and
 amortization and changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
 
      At September 30, 1999, total outstanding notes and loans payable
 was $1,087.4 million as compared to $1,114.8 million at March 31, 1999.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $7.0 million for the
 six months ended September 30, 1999.  Cash used by operating
 activities was $2.8 million for the six months ended September 30,
 1998.  The increase resulted from a combination of increased earnings
 and changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Cash flows used by operating activities were $6.6 million and
 $8.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The 1999 to 1998 change resulted from decreased paid
 losses recoverable and increased other liabilities offset by an
 increase in other assets and the change in both unearned premium and
 loss and loss expense reserves.
 
      Republic's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment
 portfolio were $10.5 million and $2.9 million at June 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the
 timing difference of maturities/calls being reinvested.  This level of
 liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet
 periodic needs.  Capital and operating budgets allow Republic to
 schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting
 proceeds.
 
      Republic maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio,
 primarily in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 96.1% of the fixed-
 income securities consisting of investment grade securities.  The
 maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to
 meet future cash needs.  Current liquidity remains strong with current
 invested assets equal to 106.1% of total liabilities.
 
      The liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon
 company historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment
 expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses
 paid to losses paid.  Unpaid loss and loss expenses are not
 discounted.
 
      Stockholder's equity was $213.6 million and $199.6 million at
 June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Republic considers current
 stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and
 absorb unforeseen risk events.  Republic does not use debt or equity
 issues to increase capital and therefore has no exposure to capital
 market conditions.

 Life Insurance
      Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from
 interest-sensitive products, and investment income.  The primary uses
 of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.
 Matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the
 types of insurance being written is an important consideration.
 Benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored to provide
 projections of future cash requirements.
 
      Cash flows provided by operating activities were $2.4 million for
 the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998. Cash flows provided by
 financing activities were approximately $0.3 million and $7.1 million
 for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Cash
 flows from deferred annuity sales increase investment contract
 deposits, which are a component of financing activities, as well as
 the purchase of fixed maturities, which are a component of investing
 activities.  The decrease in cash flows provided by financing
 activities for the first six months of 1999 compared to the first six
 months of 1998 is due to lower ratio of annuity deposits to
 withdrawals.
 
      In addition to cash flows from operating and financing
 activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through
 Oxford's short-term portfolio.  At June 30, 1999 and 1998, short-term
 investments were $75.6 million and $22.0 million, respectively.
 Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will
 continue to meet foreseeable cash needs.
 
      Stockholder's equity of Oxford increased to $90.7 million in 1999
 from $90.1 million in 1998.  Oxford did not pay dividends to its
 parent in 1999 or 1998.
 
      Applicable laws and regulations of the State of Arizona require
 AMERCO's insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and
 surplus determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
 With respect to Oxford, the amount is $450,000.  In addition, the
 amount of dividends that can be paid to shareholders by insurance
 companies domiciled in the State of Arizona is limited.  Any dividend
 in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval.  Statutory
 surplus which can be distributed as dividends without regulatory
 approval is $0.7 million at June 30, 1999.  These restrictions are not
 expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of AMERCO to
 meet its cash obligation.
 
 Consolidated Group
      During each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000, 2001 and
 2002, U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average
 approximately $325 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.
 This level of capital expenditures, combined with an average of
 approximately $30-$115 million in annual long-term debt maturities
 during this same period, are expected to create annual average funding
 needs of approximately $355-$440 million.  Management estimates that
 U-Haul will fund 100% of these requirements with internally generated
 funds, including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and
 other asset sales.
 
 Credit Agreements
      AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured
 medium-term notes, and revolving lines of credit with domestic and
 foreign banks.  Principally to finance its fleet of trucks and
 trailers, AMERCO routinely enters into sale and leaseback
 transactions.  As of September 30, 1999, AMERCO had $1,087.4 million
 in total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized lines of
 credit of approximately $225.0 million.
 
      Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive
 financial and other covenants, including, among others, covenants with
 respect to incurring additional indebtedness, maintaining certain
 financial ratios, and placing certain additional liens on its
 properties and assets.  At September 30, 1999, AMERCO was in
 compliance with these covenants.
 
      AMERCO is further restricted in the issuance of certain types of
 preferred stock.  AMERCO is prohibited from issuing shares of
 preferred stock that provide for any mandatory redemption, sinking
 fund payment, or mandatory prepayment, or that allow the holders
 thereof to require AMERCO or any subsidiary of AMERCO to repurchase
 such preferred stock at the option of such holders or upon the
 occurrence of any event or events without the consent of its lenders.

 Year 2000 Disclosure
      AMERCO is and has been working since 1997 to identify and
 complete the changes necessary to its existing computerized business
 systems to make these systems compliant for Year 2000 processing.  The
 Year 2000 processing problem is caused by currently installed computer
 systems and software products, including several used by AMERCO, being
 coded to accept only the last two digit entries in the date code field
 instead of four digits to indicate the year.  Such programs may
 interpret the year 2000 to mean 1900 instead, producing erroneous
 information or date-related computer failures.
 
      AMERCO's date reliance functions related to the Year 2000 and
 beyond, such as rental transaction processing and financial systems,
 may be adversely affected unless these computer systems are or become
 Year 2000 compliant on a timely basis.  Replacing, upgrading or
 modifying key financial systems has been on-going in the normal course
 of business.  AMERCO is utilizing both internal and external resources
 to identify, correct, reprogram and test its systems for Year 2000
 compliance.  In particular, AMERCO has an outside consulting firm on-
 site currently making the Year 2000 compliance related modifications
 to existing systems. AMERCO's internal information technology
 conversion phase is underway, with the testing phase going on at the
 same time.
 
      AMERCO has communicated with its major business partners to
 determine the efforts being made on their part for compliance.
 Electronic data interchange with critical vendors has been tested.
 Testing has been completed with major banking partners and credit card
 processors.  Approximately 90% of major business partners have given
 AMERCO written assurances that they will be Year 2000 compliant.
 However, there can be no assurance AMERCO will not be adversely affected by
 the failure of others to become Year 2000 compliant.  For example, AMERCO
 may be affected by, among other things, the failure of inventory
 suppliers, credit card processors, security companies or other vendors
 and service providers to become Year 2000 compliant.
 
      AMERCO expects all of its critical systems to be Year 2000
 compliant by calendar year end.  AMERCO started with an
 initial budget of $2.0 million; as the conversion process continued,
 this amount was increased to $2.8 million.  Through September 30,
 1999, $2.5 million has been incurred for Year 2000 related work.
 AMERCO has not deferred any major computer programming or update
 projects due to Year 2000 efforts.  Although AMERCO believes it will
 achieve compliance on a timely basis, no assurance can be given that
 AMERCO's computer systems will be Year 2000 compliant in a timely manner
 or that AMERCO will not incur significant additional costs pursuing
 Year 2000 compliance.  If the appropriate modifications are not made,
 or are not timely, the Year 2000 problem may have a material adverse
 effect on AMERCO.
 
      AMERCO considers its most likely worst case scenario to be if a
 business partner is not Year 2000 compliant and direct processing of electronic
 data is inhibited.  AMERCO's contingency plan, to be used if a business partner
 is not Year 2000 compliant, will include manual processing of rental
 transactions; manual preparation of payments to employees, vendors and
 claimants; manual licensing of equipment; manual preparation of financial
 statements and the movement of funds.  AMERCO expects that the cost of
 conducting business manually would not have a material impact on its financial
 position.  While AMERCO feels testing has been adequate and successful, the
 contingency plans have been formulated, with refinement continuing until the
 year 2000.
 
      Despite AMERCO's efforts to date, there can be no assurance that
 the Year 2000 problem will not have a material adverse effect on
 AMERCO in the future.
