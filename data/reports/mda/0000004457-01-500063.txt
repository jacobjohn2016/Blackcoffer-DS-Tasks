 General
 - -------
      Information on fiscal year and industry segments is incorporated by
 reference to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1, 20
 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".  The notes discuss the
 principles of consolidation, summarized consolidated financial information and
 industry segment and geographic area data, respectively.  In consolidation, all
 intersegment premiums are eliminated and the benefits, losses and expenses are
 retained by the insurance companies.
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 - -------------------------------
 
 Consolidated Group
      To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain a large inventory
 of fixed asset rental items.  At March 31, 2001, net property, plant and
 equipment represented approximately 63.1% of total assets from non-insurance
 operations and approximately 40.2% of consolidated assets.  In fiscal year
 2001, gross capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $358.9
 million, as compared to $417.6 million and $298.5 million in fiscal years 2000
 and 1999, respectively.  These expenditures primarily reflect the replacement
 of certain rental trucks and trailers.  The capital needs required to fund
 these acquisitions were funded with internally generated funds from operations
 and lease financings.
 
      During each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
 U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately $232
 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.  This level of capital
 expenditures, combined with a potential range of $77.5-$175 million in annual
 long-term debt maturities, are expected to create annual average funding needs
 of approximately $333-$408 million.  Management estimates that U-Haul will
 fund 100% of these requirements with leases and internally generated funds,
 including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales.
 
 Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
      Net cash provided by operating activities was $126.1 million, $237.7
 million and $159.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Details by material segment follows:
 
   Moving and Storage Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $39.7 million, $147.5 million and
 $128.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease
 from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001 is mainly due to a decrease in
 intercompany payable. The increase from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 is
 partially due to an increase in net income.
 <PAGE>  15
 
   Real Estate Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $50.5 million, $24.8 million and
 $38.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
 in fiscal year 2001, is due to an increase in intercompany payable. This is
 due to dividends paid related to the sale of property.  The decrease in
 fiscal year 2000, is due to a decrease in the intercompany payable.
 
   Property and Casualty
      Cash provided (used) by operating activities was $21.1 million, $(11.1)
 million and $(21.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively. The 2000 to 1999 change resulted from increased premium
 collections and funds withheld, offset by increased loss and loss adjustment
 expense payments and policy acquisition costs associated with new business
 production. The 1999 to 1998 change resulted from the increased funds withheld
 liability, decreased paid losses recoverable and a smaller decrease in loss and
 loss adjustment expense reserves.  This was offset by increased premiums and
 agents' balances and the intercompany receivable due from affiliates.
 
      RepWest's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio
 were $17.0 million, $6.0 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  This balance reflects funds in transition from maturity
 proceeds to long-term investments.  This level of liquid assets, combined with
 budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet periodic needs.  Capital and operating
 budgets allow RepWest to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and
 underwriting proceeds.
 <PAGE>  16
   LIFE INSURANCE
      Cash provided by operating activities was $8.7 million, $22.2 million and
 $34.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2000 and
 1999 relates to paid loss experience.  In 2000, cash flows provided by financing
 activities were $14.7 million, $3.2 million and $32.0 million for the years
 ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Cash flows from deferred
 annuity sales increase investment contract deposits, which are a component of
 financing activities, as well as the purchase of fixed maturities, which are a
 component of investing activities.  The increase in 2000 from 1999 is due to a
 higher ratio of annuity deposits versus withdrawals, the opposite occurred in
 1999 compared to 1998.
 
      Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest-
 sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of cash are
 operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching the investment
 portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an
 important consideration.  Benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored
 to provide projections of future cash requirements.
 
      In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a
 substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-term
 portfolio.  Short-term investments amounted to $45.0 million, $30.7 million and
 $63.4 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Management
 believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable
 cash needs.
 
 Consolidated Stockholder's Equity
      Consolidated stockholder's equity was $615.4, $585.3 and $616.0 million for
 the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
 follow:
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      U-Haul's stockholder's equity was $522.9 million, $435.2 million and $384.7
 million for the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
 in fiscal year 2001 is mainly the result of increased additional paid in capital
 due to the sale of property to a related party.  The increase in fiscal year
 2000 was due to earnings.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Real Estate stockholder's equity was $89.1 million, $96.1 million and $79.5
 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in
 fiscal year 2001 relates to the payment of a dividend to U-Haul partially
 offset by increased earnings.  The increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to
 earnings.
 <PAGE>  17
 
    Property and Casualty
      RepWest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily
 in bonds at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-income securities
 consisting of investment grade securities.  The maturity distribution is
 designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current
 liquidity remains strong, with current invested assets equal to 81.8% of total
 liabilities.
 
      The liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon both
 RepWest's historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are
 based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.
 Unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted.
 
      RepWest's stockholder's equity was $192.1 million, $208.5 million and
 $211.4 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease
 from 1999 to 2000 is a result of an operating loss and a change in market value
 for the available for sale investment portfolio.  RepWest considers current
 stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and absorb
 unforeseen risk events.  RepWest does not use debt or equity issues to increase
 capital and therefore has no exposure to capital market conditions.
 
    Life Insurance
      Oxford's stockholder's equity was $99.8 million, $88.1 million and $93.6
 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 is
 a result of earnings and change in market value for the available for sale
 investment portfolio.  The decrease from 1998 to 1999 was due to the change in
 market value for the available for sale investment portfolio offset by earnings.
 Oxford did not pay dividends to its parent during 2000, 1999 or 1998.
 
 Insurance Operations
 - --------------------
      Applicable laws and regulations of the State of Arizona require RepWest and
 Oxford to maintain minimum capital determined in accordance with statutory
 accounting practices.  Such amount is $1.0 million and $0.4 million, for RepWest
 and Oxford, respectively.  In addition, the amount of dividends that can be paid
 to stockholders by insurance companies domiciled in the State of Arizona is
 limited.  Any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory
 approval.  Statutory surplus which can be distributed as dividends without
 regulatory approval is $11.7 million and $0.7 million for RepWest and Oxford,
 respectively at December 31, 2000.  These restrictions are not expected to have
 a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to meet its cash
 obligations.  Oxford issued a surplus note to AMERCO on December 31, 1998 for
 $10.0 million.  Approval by the Arizona Department of Insurance is required
 prior to payment of principal and interest.
 
 Credit Agreements
 - -----------------
      AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured medium-term
 notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.  To finance
 its fleet of trucks and trailers, U-Haul routinely enters into sale and
 leaseback transactions.  As of March 31, 2001, AMERCO had $1,156.8 million in
 total notes and loans outstanding and unutilized committed lines of credit of
 approximately $94.9 million.
 
      Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
 other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
 additional indebtedness, issuing mandatory repayment preferred stock,
 maintaining certain financial ratios and placing certain additional liens on its
 properties and assets.  At March 31, 2001, AMERCO was in compliance with these
 covenants.
 
      Reference is made to Note 5 in Item 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
 Statements.
 
 Results of Operations - Consolidated
 - ------------------------------------
 
 Consolidated Rental Revenue
      Rental revenue, net of commission expense was $1,205.0 million, $1,150.5
 million, and $1,074.2 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Details by material segment follow:
 <PAGE>  18
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
      Rental revenue was $1,202.4 million, $1,148.2 million and $1,072.1 million
 in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase from fiscal
 year 2000 to fiscal year 2001 is due to an increase in one way transactions with
 an improved average dollar per transaction on one way rentals as well as growth
 in transactions in trailer rentals and support rental items.  The increase from
 fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 was primarily due to the growth in truck
 rental revenues which benefited from transactional growth and reflects a higher
 average revenue per transaction.
 
    Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue, before intercompany eliminations, were $71.9 million, $73.4
 million and $74.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Intercompany rental revenue was $71.1 million, $71.0 million and $71.9 million
 in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year
 2001 is related to the sale of properties to a related party while rental
 revenue was consistent between fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000.
 
 Consolidated Net Sales
      Net sales revenues were $194.3 million, $188.8 million and $181.3 million
 in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth from the sale
 of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.) and propane resulted in the increase
 for each year.
 
 Consolidated Premiums
      Premium revenues, after intercompany eliminations, were $323.2 million,
 $262.1 million and $226.8 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Details by material segment follow:
 
    Property and Casualty
      Premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were $218.1 million,
 $173.8 million and $145.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  General agency premiums were $64.3 million, $17.8
 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 was the result of two new agency
 programs.  Assumed treaty reinsurance premiums were $83.2 million, $80.7 million
 and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  Rental industry revenues were $43.3 million, $50.3 million and
 $66.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  This decline was caused by cost measures implemented on the
 U-Haul rental industry Business Auto General Liability Policy.
 
    Life Insurance
      Premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were $112.6 million,
 $96.4 million and $94.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  Oxford increased Medicare supplement premiums through
 direct writings and the acquisition of Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company
 (CFLIC); these actions increased premiums by $12.5 million and $19.1 million
 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Premiums from Oxford's life insurance lines
 decreased $1.7 million and increased $1.1 million from 2000 and 1999,
 respectively due to production fluctuations from year to year.  In the area
 of credit insurance, Oxford increased direct writings as well as reduced
 the amount ceded to outside reinsurers.  These factors contributed to
 a $3.3 million and $6.7 million increase in premium from 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Annuitizations increased by $1.1 million and decreased $3.0
 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Premiums decreased $5.3 million in
 1999 due to the sale of NAFCIC.  Other health insurance premiums increased
 $1.0 million in 2000 due to a higher reinsurance retention level and decreased
 $0.5 million in 1999 due to the elimination of certain NAI health lines.
 
 Consolidated Net Investment and Interest Income
      Net investment and interest income was $91.2 million, $82.2 million and
 $73.4 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by
 material segment follow:
 
   Moving and Storage Operations
      Interest income was $27.9 million, $19.5 million and $12.9 million in
 fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase in fiscal year
 2001 is mainly related to increased storage loan activity.  The increase in
 interest during fiscal year 2000 reflects higher average note receivable
 balances.
 <PAGE>  19
 
   Real Estate Operations
      Net investment and interest income was $11.0 million, $7.0 million and $4.5
 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase in
 fiscal year 2001 is related to increased investments.  The increase in fiscal
 year 2000 is due to interest income received on notes receivable.
 
   Property and Casualty
      Net investment income was $29.1 million, $33.0 million and $35.8 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 reductions are attributable to decreased gains and lower annual average invested
 assets, as well as the write down of $3.0 million of fixed maturity investments
 during 2000.
 
   Life Insurance
      Net investment income was $22.2 million, $21.5 million and $20.1 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This
 increase is due to improved interest rate spreads on the retirement savings
 products offset by write downs of $3.5 million of fixed maturity investments
 during 2000.
 
 Consolidated Operating Expenses
      Operating expenses were $998.8 million, $919.1 million and $877.6 million
 in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
 follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
      Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $986.5 million,
 $931.1 million and $893.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The increased expense in fiscal year 2001 is due to increased
 personnel cost, higher repair expense, a substantial lawsuit settlement and
 other administrative costs.  Also, the addition of storage rooms will initially
 cause an increase in operating expenses without corresponding increases in
 earnings until the properties reach a stabilized level of occupancy.  The
 increase in fiscal year 2000 is due to the increased cost of liability
 insurance, due to transactional growth, increased personnel costs and other
 administrative costs.
 
    Real Estate Operations
      Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $0.4 million,
 $4.0 million and $6.2 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease in fiscal year 2001 is due to an increase in intercompany lease
 payments which lowers their operating expense.  Real Estate benefited from a
 reduction in intercompany management fees charged by an affiliated segment
 company during fiscal year 2000 compared to the prior two years.
 
   Property and Casualty
      Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $56.7 million,
 $35.0 million and $35.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  The increase is due to commission expenses associated with
 the growth in written premium and a $4.6 million decrease in the capitalization
 of deferred acquisition costs for the year ended December 2000 as well as
 general and administrative expenses required to support the new business
 expansion.  Commission expenses were $33.1 million, $19.1 million and $18.8
 million for the years ended December 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 Lease expenses increased to $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the
 years ended December 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  All other underwriting
 expenses consisted of $21.4 million, $13.9 million and $15.5 million for the
 years ended December 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 
    Life Insurance
      Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $29.0 million,
 $23.1 million and $20.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  Commissions have increased $7.3 million and $9.1 million
 in 2000 and 1999, respectively, primarily due to the increase in Medicare
 supplement premiums.  General and administrative expenses net of fees collected
 decreased $1.4 million and $0.5 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
 Consolidated Cost of Sales
      Cost of sales was $117.2 million, $112.0 million and $106.8 million in
 fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Increased material costs and a
 higher sales volume related to moving support items contributed to the increases
 in both fiscal years 2001 and 2000.
 <PAGE>  20
 
 Consolidated Benefits and Losses
      Benefits and losses were $283.4 million, $209.6 million and $176.6 million
 in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
 follow:
 
    Property and Casualty
      Benefits and losses incurred were $204.1 million, $150.5 million and $118.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 increase from 1999 to 2000 resulted from two new general agency programs and
 reserve strengthening in existing rental industry, assumed treaty reinsurance
 and general agency programs.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the
 increased assumed treaty reinsurance claims as well as an arbitration loss.  The
 arbitration loss caused $6.3 million of previously ceded reserves to be brought
 back into RepWest's retention.
 <PAGE>  21
 
    Life Insurance
      Benefits incurred were $79.2 million, $59.0 million and $57.7 million for
 the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase
 is primarily due to Medicare supplement benefits incurred, which accounts for
 $16.7 million and $21.2 million of benefit increases in 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  These increases are due to larger volumes of business and poor
 experience on blocks no longer actively marketed.  Credit insurance
 benefits increased from $2.1 million and $2.8 million in 2000 and 1999,
 respectively due to the increase in volume written and retained.  Benefits from
 other health lines increased $2.5 million and $0.5 million in 2000 and 1999,
 respectively as volume increased and loss experience worsened.  Annuity and life
 benefits decreased $1.1 million and $2.1 million in 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The sale of NAFCIC reduced benefits $0.9 million from 1998.
 
 Consolidated Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs
      Amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and the value of business
 acquired (VOBA) was $35.9 million, $35.0 million and $31.7 million in fiscal
 years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  DAC consists of commissions and other
 policy acquisition costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the
 production of new business.  The prior year end commissions and other related
 expenses are recognized ratably over the remainder of the policy year.  Details
 by material segment follow:
 
    Property and Casualty
      The prior year-end commissions and other related expenses are amortized
 over the following year.  The amortization expense was $16.3 million, $13.4
 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 is mainly due to the amortization
 of Assumed Treaty expenses that were deferred in the 1999 year.  The increase
 from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to RepWest's subsidiary company's DAC expense,
 which increased to $3.8 million from $0.2 million in 1998.  This was due to a
 change in classification of the amortization expense of the subsidiary to
 RepWest capitalization.
 
    Life Insurance
      The VOBA asset relates to the future profits of insurance policies in
 force at the date of the NAI and CFLIC acquisitions.  Amortization of DAC and
 VOBA was $19.6 million, $21.6 million and $24.3 million for the years ended
 December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  These costs are amortized as
 the premium is earned over the term of the policy.  Amortization decreased $2.0
 million from 1999 due to the annuity and credit segments and decreased $3.0
 million from 1998 due to the sale of NAFCIC.
 
 Consolidated Lease Expense
      Lease expense was $178.5 million, $136.0 million and $118.7 million in
 fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
 follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
      Lease expense was $166.2 million, $132.4 million and $118.4 million in
 fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The continued increase reflects
 additional leasing activity of rental equipment.
 
    Real Estate Operations
      Lease expense before intercompany eliminations, for real estate
 operations was $11.6 million, $3.0 million and $0.1 million for the fiscal
 years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The continued increase in fiscal
 year 2001 and fiscal year 2000 over the prior years reflects payments under
 an operating lease facility with a number of financial institutions whereby
 the Company is both lessee and construction agent developing storage
 properties.
 <PAGE>  22
 
 Consolidated Depreciation Expense, net
      Depreciation expense, net was $88.1 million, $87.6 million and $73.1
 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material
 segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
      Depreciation expense, net was $82.7 million, $79.0 million and $61.0
 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
 in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 reflects an increase in depreciation expense
 on the rental truck fleet.
 
    Real Estate Operations
      Depreciation expense, net was $5.3 million, $8.6 million and $12.0 million
 in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year
 2001 reflects an increase in gains from the disposition of property, plant and
 equipment.  The decrease in fiscal year 2000 reflects an increase in gains from
 the disposition of property, plant and equipment and a decrease in depreciation
 on buildings and non-rental equipment.
 
 Consolidated Earnings from Operations
      Earnings from operations were $111.8 million, $184.3 million and $171.3
 million  in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material
 segment follow:
 
    Moving and Storage Operations
      Earnings from operations, before intercompany eliminations, were $73.7
 million, $102.0 million and $87.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year 2001 is due to increased
 transactions, offset by increased operating and lease expenses.  In fiscal year
 2000, increased rental transactions, offset by corresponding expenses,
 contributed to the earnings gain.
 
    Real Estate Operations
      Earnings from operations, before intercompany eliminations, were $65.8
 million, $64.7 million and $60.3 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The increase in fiscal year 2001 is mainly related to higher net
 investment interest income.  A decrease in intercompany management fees charged
 contributed to the earnings increase for fiscal year 2000.
 
    Property and Casualty
      Earnings (loss) from operations were $(29.9) million, $7.9 million and
 $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The decrease in 2000 was due to reserve strengthening and
 losses on two new general agency programs as well as the write downs of fixed
 maturity investments whose declines in value were determined to be other than
 temporary.  The 1998 to 1999 decrease resulted mainly from RepWest's writing
 off the 1995 American Bonding receivable, lower than forecasted premium volume
 in 1999 and higher than expected losses on the agricultural business.
 
    Life Insurance
      Earnings from operations were $7.0 million, $14.2 million and $12.2 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease in 2000 from both 1999 and 1998 was due to write downs of fixed
 maturity investments whose declines in value were determined to be other than
 temporary and poor Medicare supplement loss experience.  The increase in
 earnings from 1998 to 1999 was due to improved investment returns and improved
 loss experience on the credit insurance business.
 
 Consolidated Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $87.8 million, $81.5 million and $73.7 million in
 fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase can be attributed
 to an increase in the average cost of debt in fiscal year 2001 over the past two
 fiscal years.  The average debt level outstanding continued to increase in
 fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal years 2000 and 1999.

 Consolidated Extraordinary Loss on the Extinguishment of Debt
 
      During fiscal year 2001, AMERCO extinguished $100.0 million of 6.89% Bond
 Backed Asset Trust certificates (BATs) originally due in fiscal year 2011 and
 $25.0 million of 6.7% Medium-Term notes originally due in fiscal year 2009.
 This resulted in an extraordinary loss of $2.1 million, net of tax of $1.2
 million ($0.10 per share).
 
      During fiscal year 2000, AMERCO extinguished $100.0 million of 6.65% Bond
 Backed Asset Trust certificates (BATs) originally due in fiscal year 2030 and
 $50.0 million of 7.05% to 7.10% Medium-Term notes originally due in fiscal year
 2007.  This resulted in an extraordinary loss of $0.3 million, net of tax of
 $0.2 million ($0.02 per share).
 
 
 Consolidated Earnings
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $24.0 million, $102.7
 million and $97.6 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 After providing for income taxes, earnings from operations were $15.1 million,
 $65.8 million and $62.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Following deductions for an extraordinary loss from the early
 extinguishment of debt, net earnings were $13.0 million, $65.5 million and $62.5
 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
 Quarterly Results
      The table on page 24 presents unaudited quarterly results for the eight
 quarters in the period beginning April 1, 1999 and ending March 31, 2001.
 The Income Statement amounts for the quarter ended December 31, 2000 have
 been restated to increase the net loss by $.10 per share due to necessary
 revisions of certain fixed asset transactions.  The restated loss per share
 was $1.05 for the third quarter fiscal year 2001 as compared to $.95 as
 reported.  AMERCO believes that all necessary adjustments have been included
 in the amounts stated below to present fairly, and in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, the selected quarterly information
 when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
 incorporated herein by reference.  U-Haul moving and storage operations are
 seasonal and proportionally more of AMERCO's revenues and net earnings from
 its U-Haul moving and storage operations are generated in the first and second
 quarters of each fiscal year (April through September).  The operating results
 for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for any
 future period.

 Stockholder Litigation
      AMERCO has deducted for income tax purposes approximately $372.0 million of
 the payments made to former shareholders in a stockholder lawsuit.  While AMERCO
 believes that such income tax deductions are appropriate, there can be no
 assurance that such deductions ultimately will be allowed in full.  Reference is
 made to Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
 discussion of the stockholder litigation.
 
 Other
      New pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 adopted during the year are not material to the consolidated financial
 statements of AMERCO.  Further, pronouncements with future effective dates are
 either not applicable or not material to the consolidated financial statements
 of AMERCO.
