         OF OPERATIONS.
 
 OVERVIEW
 
          The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
 nationally branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding
 copy paper) in the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products
 industry. The Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing
 pads, file folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products.
 Through its Ampad division, the Company is among the largest and most important
 suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies,
 machine papers and retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing
 office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is
 the leading supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business
 envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its
 future operating results will not be directly comparable to its historical
 operating results because of its strategic acquisitions and the expected cost
 savings from integration of its acquisitions. The Company's business has not
 generally been seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may
 affect prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.
 
          Strategic Acquisition. On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired
 Shade/Allied, a national supplier of machine papers, principally continuous
 computer forms. The purchase price of $50.7 million was financed with
 borrowings under the Company's bank credit agreement. Shade/Allied's products
 are distributed by both the Ampad and Williamhouse divisions and the
 manufacturing plants are integrated into the Ampad division. This acquisition
 provided the Company with a more significant position in a fourth product
 category.
 
          Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been
 accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have
 currently affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of
 operations in certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs
 (including assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based
 on the fair market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase
 price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such
 as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill,
 which results in incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each
 year.
 
          Paper Prices. Paper represents a majority of the Company's cost of
 goods sold. While paper prices have increased by an average of less than 1%
 annually since 1989, certain commodity grades have shown considerable price
 volatility during that period. Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted
 new pricing policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the
 Company's cost of paper at the time of shipment. The Company believes that it
 is able to price its products so as to minimize the impact of price volatility
 on dollar margins. Paper price volatility has and is expected to continue to
 have an effect on net sales and cost of sales.
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
          The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
 operations as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended
 September 30, 1997 and 1996. The Company's historical results of operations for
 each of these periods are significantly affected by the results for the
 following business acquired by the Company: (i) Niagara which was acquired on
 June 28, 1996 and (ii) Shade/Allied which was acquired on February 11, 1997.

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                                   (CONTINUED)
 
 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED
 SEPTEMBER 30, 1996
 
          Net Sales for the three months ended September 30, 1997 increased by
 $2.9 million, or 1.7%, to $176.5 million from $173.6 million for the three
 months ended September 30, 1996. Of this net sales increase, $18.2 million is
 related to the acquisition of Shade/Allied offset by a decrease in net sales
 from existing operations of approximately $15.3 million primarily as the result
 of reduced sales in the mass merchant and superstores customer channels.
 
 Gross Profit for the three months ended September 30, 1997 decreased by $7.8
 million, or 21.7%, to $28.2 million from $36.0 million for the three months
 ended September 30, 1996. The acquisition of Shade/Allied resulted in an
 increase in gross profit of approximately $2.4 million. The remaining decrease
 in gross profit of approximately $10.2 million is attributable to the reduced
 sales from existing operations. Gross profit margin decreased to 16.0% for the
 three months ended September 30, 1997 from 20.8% for the three months ended
 September 30, 1996. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily
 attributable to increases in sales of relatively lower margin products,
 including those of Shade/Allied, as well as a highly competitive pricing market
 in the third quarter of 1997.
 
          SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 1997 increased
 $2.4 million, or 18.9%, to $14.9 million from $12.5 million for the three
 months ended September 30, 1996. This increase in SG&A expenses is primarily
 attributable to the acquisition of Shade/Allied. Management fees and services
 expense for the third quarter of 1997 decreased by approximately $1.2 million
 as compared to the same quarter of 1996 due primarily to a one year
 non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara.
 
          Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 1997 of $9.9
 million was approximately equal to interest expense for the three months ended
 September 30, 1996.
 
          The income tax provision for the three month period ended September
 30, 1997 reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate
 of 43.2% for the three month period ended September 30, 1996. The increase is
 attributable primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting
 from the Shade/Allied acquisition.
 
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 
 30, 1996
 
          Net Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 increased by
 $85.7 million, or 21.0%, to $493.5 million from $407.8 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 1996. Of this net sales increase, $52.7 million is
 related to the acquisition of Niagara and $46.5 million is related to the
 acquisition of Shade/Allied. The remaining decrease of approximately $13.5
 million is attributable to existing operations and primarily is the result of
 reduced sales in the mass merchant and superstores customer channels.
 
          Gross Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 increased by
 $7.5 million, or 8.9%, to $92.0 million from $84.5 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 1996. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase in gross
 profit is attributable to the acquisition of Niagara and $5.8 million is
 attributable to the Shade/Allied acquisition. The remaining decrease in gross
 profit of approximately $5.8 million is primarily attributable to reduced sales
 from existing operations and competitive pricing pressures. Gross profit margin
 decreased to 18.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 from 20.7% for
 the nine months ended September 30, 1996. The decrease in gross profit margin
 is primarily attributable to the addition of sales of the relatively lower
 margin Shade/Allied products and the highly competitive pricing environment
 experienced in 1997.

          SG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 increased
 $7.3 million, or 21.4%, to $41.5 million from $34.2 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 1996. The acquisitions of Niagara and Shade/Allied resulted
 in additional expense for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 of
 approximately $6.3 million. Management fees and services expense for the first
 nine months of 1997 increased by approximately $1.4 million as compared to the
 comparable period of 1996 due primarily to a one year non-recurring consulting
 agreement with the former president of Niagara which commenced in the third
 quarter of 1996.
 
          Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 1997
 decreased $7.3 million to $27.7 million from $35.0 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 1996. The decrease is primarily attributable to the
 reduction in long-term debt which resulted from the Company's initial public
 offering of common stock in the third quarter of 1996. This decrease in
 indebtedness was partially offset by increased borrowings required for the
 Shade/Allied acquisition and for the increase in working capital.
 
          The income tax provision for the nine month period ended September 30,
 1997 reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate of
 43.2% for the nine month period ended September 30, 1996. The increase is
 attributable primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting
 from the Niagara and Shade/Allied acquisitions.
 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
          Net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1997 of $30.3 million was primarily the net result of the
 following: (i) cash provided from net income of $25.9 million after adjustment
 for non-cash expenses, (ii) an increase in accounts receivable of $9.6 million
 as a result of the increased sales volumes, (iii) an increase in inventories
 net of increased accounts payable of $32.1 million due to a buildup in
 anticipation of seasonal, promotional and new product sales and (iv) a
 reduction in accrued expenses of $21.6 million as annual customer volume
 rebates and incentive compensation were paid early in 1997.
 
           Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
 30, 1997 of $62.8 million was due to the acquisition of Shade/Allied and
 purchases of equipment.
 
          Net cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months
 of 1997 was $91.5 million and primarily resulted from repayment of $7.0 million
 in financing outstanding under the accounts receivable credit facility and
 borrowings of $99.4 million under the bank credit agreement to finance: (i)
 such repayment, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii) the purchases of
 equipment and (iv) growth in working capital.
 
          Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
 anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
 available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement
 and the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at September
 30, 1997 of $.7 million, will be adequate for the foreseeable future to make
 required payments of principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to
 fund anticipated capital expenditures, including anticipated capital
 expenditures of approximately $2 million during the remainder of 1997, and
 to meet working capital requirements.
 
          As part of the Company's expected growth in the near term and in 
 connection with certain potential acquisitions which may be completed in the
 next year, the Company has commenced discussions with its lenders to increase
 the amount of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit agreement
 and to modify certain debt covenants. The Company has been given preliminary
 oral indications the results of such discussions will be favorable. To the
 extent that the Company does not obtain these changes to its existing revolving
 credit agreement, the Company may not be in compliance with the required
 minimum ratio of consolidated debt to EDITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
 depreciation and amortization) at the end of the fourth quarter of 1997. The
 Company expects that its banking group will either waive such covenant or amend
 the required ratio to an acceptable level for 1998. In the unlikely event that
 neither a waiver or amendment is obtained, it may be necessary for the Company
 to reduce its capital spending in 1998, alter its capital asset financing
 programs in 1998 or lower its operating costs during 1998 in order to meet the
 required ratio of consolidated debt to EDITDA.
 
          Additionally, the ability of the Company to meet its debt service
 obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future
 performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject
 to general economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors,
 including factors beyond the Company's control. A portion of the consolidated
 debt of the Company bears interest at floating rates; therefore, its financial
 condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest
 rates. The Company has entered into an interest rate protection agreement to
 minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.

 INFLATION
 
          The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on
 its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
 1997 and 1996.
 
 NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD
 
          The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of 
          Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which is
          effective December 15, 1997 and which prescribes a new presentation of
          earnings per share amounts as either "basic" or "diluted." Basic
          earnings per share is to be calculated as net income divided by the
          number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per
          share is to be calculated in a manner similar to the "primary" earnings
          per share currently presented by the Company. Diluted earnings per
          share is calculated as net income divided by the number of outstanding
          shares of common stock, as adjusted for common stock options. The
          Company intends to implement the new accounting standard at the end of
          1997 and,  as part of its 1997 annual report to shareholders and Form
          10-K, will restate its quarterly earnings per share following the
          guidelines in the new accounting standard. If the new standard had been
          implemented during the third quarter of 1997, earnings per share would
          have been presented as follows:
