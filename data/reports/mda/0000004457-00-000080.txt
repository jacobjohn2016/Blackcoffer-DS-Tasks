 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 VERSUS QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 1999
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales.  Total rental revenue
 was $322.3 million and $305.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and
 1999, respectively.  Net revenues from the rental of moving related equipment
 increased by $13.3 million.  This increase is primarily attributable to higher
 truck rental revenues.  The growth in truck rental revenue primarily reflects
 higher truck rental inventory.  Storage revenues increased $4.2 million due to
 increases in rates and in the number of storage rooms rented.
 
      Net sales revenues were $60.1 million and $57.6 million for the quarters
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth resulted from a 7.4%
 increase in the sale of moving support items and a 3.4% increase in the sale of
 hitches.
 
      Cost of sales was $33.2 million and $31.4 million for the quarters ended
 June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  A higher sales volume contributed to the
 increase.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations were $235.6 million and
 $224.2 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Increased expenditure levels for personnel and rental equipment maintenance, due
 to an increase in truck rental transactions and in fleet size, were primarily
 responsible.
 
      Lease expense was $37.7 million and $31.2 million for the quarters ended
 June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase reflects additional leasing
 activity over the past twelve months.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $20.1 million and $16.7 million for the
 quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase reflects an
 increase in depreciation recognized on the rental truck fleet.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $61.3 million
 and $63.2 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease reflects increases in operating expenses over increases in
 revenues.
 
 <PAGE> 20
 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $18.2 million for the
 quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999.  Intercompany revenue was $17.7 million
 and $17.6 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $2.1 million and $2.4 million for
 the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This decrease
 correlates to a reduction in Real Estate's average note and mortgage receivables
 balance outstanding.
 
      Lease expense was $2.6 million and a negligible amount for the quarters
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase reflects payments
 under a synthetic lease facility being utilized to develop storage properties.
 These expenses had been charged to Moving and Storage Operations during the
 first quarter of fiscal year 2000.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $2.6 million and $2.1 million for the quarters
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase primarily reflects a
 $0.4 million decrease in gains from the disposition of property.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $15.2 million
 and $18.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease reflects increases in lease expenses.
 
 Property and Casualty
      RepWest's premiums were $30.4 million and $33.8 million for the quarters
 ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease is largely a
 result of a restructuring of the U-Haul Business Auto General Liability policy.
 This reduced premiums by $5.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 as
 compared to 1999.  General agency premium increased to $7.6 million for the
 quarter ended March 31, 2000 from $4.0 million for the quarter ended
 March 31, 1999.  Direct multiple peril and assumed treaty reinsurance premium
 remained constant at $15.4 million and $15.3 million for the quarters ended
 March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Net investment income declined to $8.0 million from $8.4 million for the
 quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The reduction is
 attributable to decreased gains and accrued interest.
 
      Benefits and losses declined to $24.6 million from $28.3 million for the
 quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This decrease is due to
 the restructuring on the U-Haul Business Auto General Liability policy, as noted
 above.
 
      The amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) remained constant
 at $3.2 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999.
 
      Operating expenses were $8.3 million and $8.7 million for the quarters
 ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This was the result of a decrease
 in commissions on credit life business written by RepWest's subsidiary North
 American Fire and Casualty.  Other underwriting expenses remained constant.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $2.3 million
 and $2.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The increase of $0.3 million represents a decrease in incurred losses and loss
 adjusting expenses over a decrease in earned premiums of $0.6 million and a
 decrease in realized gains of $0.2 million.
 
 <PAGE> 21
 Life Insurance
      Net premiums increased to $25.5 million from $25.1 million for the quarters
 ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, primarily due to premium increases
 in its Medicare supplement business.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations increased to
 $5.8 million from $5.5 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively, due to improved interest rate spreads on the retirement savings
 products.
 
      Benefits increased to $17.7 million from $15.4 million for the quarters
 ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase is primarily due to
 higher loss ratios in both Medicare supplement and credit insurance.  Medicare
 supplement benefits are up 24% from 1999 in relation to the amount of insurance
 in force, which is also up 24%.  Credit insurance loss ratios have increased
 from 1999 when Oxford had better than expected loss experience.
 
      Amortization of DAC was $4.7 million and $4.6 million for the quarters
 ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Operating expenses decreased $1.1 million to $5.7 million from $6.8 million
 for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Reductions in
 general administrative expenses and commissions account for this difference.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was $3.3 million
 and $3.9 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease from 1999 reflects increased loss ratios in the credit insurance
 and Medicare supplement lines offset by improved investment returns and lower
 operating expenses.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $22.8 million and $20.2 million for the quarters ended
 June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase can be attributed to
 increases in the average debt outstanding and in the average cost of debt.
 
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $58.4 million and
 $65.4 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 After providing for income taxes, net earnings were $37.6 million and $42.3
 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

 QUARTERLY RESULTS
      The following table presents unaudited quarterly results for the nine
 quarters in the period beginning April 1, 1998 and ending June 30, 2000.  AMERCO
 believes that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated
 below to present fairly, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, its results.  U-Haul moving and storage operations are seasonal and
 proportionally more of AMERCO's revenues and net earnings from its U-Haul moving
 and storage operations are generated in the first and second quarters of each
 fiscal year (April through September).  The operating results for the periods
 presented are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain a large inventory
 of fixed asset rental items.  At June 30, 2000, net property, plant and
 equipment represented approximately 62.4% of total assets from non-insurance
 operations and approximately 42.1% of consolidated assets.  In the quarters
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, capital expenditures were $143.0 million and
 $107.1 million, respectively.  These expenditures primarily reflect the
 expansion of the rental truck fleet.  The capital required to fund these
 acquisitions was obtained through internally generated funds from operations and
 through lease financings.
 
      Cash provided by operating activities was $21.1 million and $74.1 million
 for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease
 resulted primarily from decreases in the accounts payable and intercompany
 payable balances along with decreased earnings.
 
      At June 30, 2000, total outstanding notes and loans payable was $1,123.6
 million as compared to $1,137.8 million at March 31, 2000.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 million and $0.4
 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 increase resulted from a combination of an increase in the intercompany payable
 balance, offset by decreased earnings.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Cash used by operating activities was $(5.8) million and $(3.8) million for
 quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This change resulted from
 decreased other liabilities and a larger decrease in loss and loss adjustment
 expense reserves.  Intercompany receivables due from affiliates and unearned
 premium reserves decreased.
 
      RepWest's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio
 were $1.2 million and $7.0 million at March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Short-term assets increased $5.5 million from March 31, 1999 to March 31, 2000,
 while cash on deposit decreased $11.3 million.  This $5.8 million net decrease
 resulted from increased receivables, claim settlements and incurred commissions.
 
      RepWest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily
 in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-income securities
 consisting of investment grade securities.  The maturity distribution is
 designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current
 liquidity remains strong with current invested assets equal to 95.6% of total
 liabilities.
 
      The liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon company
 historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on
 historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.  Unpaid loss
 and loss expenses are not discounted.
 
 
 <PAGE> 24
 Life Insurance
      Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest-
 sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of cash are
 operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching the investment
 portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an
 important consideration.
 
      Cash provided (used) by operating activities was $1.5 million and $(1.2)
 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 increase in cash flows from operating activities relates to better ratio of
 collected premium to paid claims.  Cash provided by financing activities were
 $3.1 million and $5.4 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities for
 the first quarter of 2000 compared to the first quarter of 1999 is due to a
 lower ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals.
 
      In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a
 substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-term
 portfolio.  At March 31, 2000 and 1999, short-term investments were $65.1
 million and $77.2 million, respectively.  Management believes that the overall
 sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs.
 
 Consolidated Group
      During each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, AMERCO
 estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately $380 million
 primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.  This level of capital expenditures,
 combined with an average of approximately $72 million in annual long-term
 debt maturities during this same period, are expected to create annual average
 funding needs of approximately $452 million.  Management estimates that
 the Company will fund 100% of these requirements with internally generated
 funds.
 
 Credit Agreements
      AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured medium-term
 notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.
 Principally to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, AMERCO routinely enters
 into sale and leaseback transactions.  As of June 30, 2000, AMERCO had $1,123.6
 million in total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized lines of
 credit of approximately $365.0 million.
 
      Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
 other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
 additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing
 certain additional liens on its properties and assets.  At June 30, 2000, AMERCO
 was in compliance with these covenants.
 
      AMERCO is further restricted in the issuance of certain types of preferred
 stock.  AMERCO is prohibited from issuing shares of preferred stock that provide
 for any mandatory redemption, sinking fund payment, or mandatory prepayment, or
 that allow the holders thereof to require AMERCO or any subsidiary of AMERCO to
 repurchase such preferred stock at the option of such holders or upon the
 occurrence of any event or events without the consent of its lenders.
 
      Reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 in AMERCO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000
 for additional information about AMERCO's credit agreements.
