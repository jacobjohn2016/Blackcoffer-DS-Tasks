                   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
 OVERVIEW
 
 AT&T Corporation (AT&T) is among the world's communications leaders, providing
 voice, data, video and broadband telecommunications services to large and small
 businesses, consumers and government agencies. We provide domestic and
 international long distance; regional, local and wireless communications
 services; cable television and Internet communications services. We also provide
 directory and calling-card services to support our communications business.
 
 TRACKING STOCKS
 
 A tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to its holders based
 on the financial performance and economic value of the assets it tracks.
 Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock or
 Liberty Media Class A or B tracking stock does not represent a direct legal
 interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but an ownership of
 AT&T in total. The specific shares represent an interest in the economic
 performance of the net assets of each of the groups.
 
 AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated business of AT&T and Liberty Media Group is
 a combination of certain assets and businesses of AT&T, neither of which is a
 stand-alone entity. As AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group are tracking
 stocks of AT&T, separate financial statements are not required to be filed. We
 have provided the financial statements as exhibits to this document to provide
 additional disclosures to investors to allow them to assess the financial
 performance of AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group. Since the tracking
 stocks are governed by a common board of directors, the AT&T board of directors
 could make operational and financial decisions or implement policies that affect
 disproportionately the businesses of any group. For example, our board of
 directors may decide to transfer funds or to reallocate assets, liabilities,
 revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups, without the consent of
 shareholders. All actions by the board of directors are subject to the board
 members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and not just to
 holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our charter, policy
 statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.
 
 Our board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forth in the
 tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretion of our
 board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-group agreement but
 without approval of our shareholders. In addition, the fact that we have
 separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests
 of the holders of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group common stock and
 Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
 conflict. Our board of directors would make any change or addition to the
 policies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, and
 would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
 in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to AT&T and all of our
 shareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interests
 and all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of
 our shares.
 
 You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our board of
 directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of a
 tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.

 RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T
 
 On October 25, 2000, AT&T announced a restructuring plan designed to fully
 separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect the financial
 performance and economic value of each of AT&T's four major operating units.
 Upon completion of the plan, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband, AT&T Business and
 AT&T Consumer will all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.
 
 As part of the first phase of the restructuring plan, on April 18, 2001, AT&T
 announced details of an offer to exchange shares of AT&T common stock for shares
 of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. On the same date, AT&T Wireless Services,
 Inc., filed its initial registration statement in connection with the planned
 split-off. Under the terms of the exchange offer, AT&T will issue 1.176 shares
 of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock in exchange for each share of AT&T common
 stock validly tendered and not withdrawn, subject to specified conditions.
 Following the exchange offer and subject to receipt of specific conditions, AT&T
 plans to split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T. AT&T intends to retain up to
 $3 billion of AT&T Wireless shares for future sale, exchange or monetization
 within six months following the split-off. We expect AT&T Wireless will become
 an independent, publicly-held company in mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate
 tax and other approvals.
 
 In addition to the split-off of AT&T Wireless, we intend to fully separate or
 issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial performance and economic
 value of each of our other major business units. We plan to create and issue new
 classes of stock to track the financial performance and economic value of our
 AT&T Broadband unit and AT&T Consumer unit. We plan to sell some percentage of
 shares of the AT&T Broadband unit in the fall of 2001. Within 12 months of such
 sale, we intend to completely separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T, as an
 asset-based stock. The AT&T Consumer tracking stock is expected to be fully
 distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of 2001.
 
 AT&T expects that these transactions will be tax-free to U.S. shareholders.
 AT&T's restructuring plan is complicated and involves a substantial number of
 steps and transactions, including obtaining various conditions, such as Internal
 Revenue Services rulings. In addition, future financial conditions, superior
 alternatives or other factors may arise or occur that make it inadvisable to
 proceed with part or all of AT&T's restructuring plans. Any or all of the
 elements of AT&T's restructuring plan may not occur as we currently expect or in
 the timeframes that we currently contemplate, or at all. Alternative forms of
 restructuring, including sales of interests in these businesses, would reduce
 what is available for distribution to shareholders in the restructuring.
 
 On April 11, 2001, the Internal Revenue Services ruled that the proposed
 split-off of Liberty Media Corporation, which will own all of the assets
 reflected in the Liberty Media Group (LMG), qualifies as a tax-free transaction
 for AT&T, Liberty Media and their shareowners. AT&T acquired Liberty Media
 through the acquisition of Tele-Communications, Inc.(TCI). AT&T does not have a
 controlling financial interest for financial accounting purposes in LMG;
 therefore, our investment in LMG is accounted for under the equity method in the
 accompanying consolidated financial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG
 are reflected as separate line items "Equity earnings (losses) from Liberty
 Media Group" and "Investment in Liberty Media Group and related receivables,
 net," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
 By mid-2001, AT&T plans to convert the LMG tracking stock into an asset-based
 security and launch Liberty Media Corporation as an independent,
 publicly-traded company.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
 This document may contain forward-looking statements with respect to AT&T's
 restructuring plan, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,
 dividends, financing plans, business strategies, operating efficiencies or
 synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, network build out and
 upgrade, competitive positions, availability of capital, growth opportunities
 for existing products, benefits from new technologies, availability and
 deployment of new technologies, plans and objectives of management, and
 other matters.
 
 These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating
 to the future business prospects, revenue, working capital, liquidity, capital
 needs, network build out, interest costs and income, are necessarily estimates
 reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number of risks
 and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
 those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
 statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important
 factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
 projections contained in the forward-looking statements including,
 without limitation:
 
 - -        the risks associated with the implementation of AT&T's restructuring
          plan, which is complicated and involves a substantial number of
          different transactions each with separate conditions, any or all of
          which may not occur as we currently intend, or which may not occur in
          the timeframe we currently expect,
 
 - -        the risks associated with each of AT&T's main business units, operating
          as independent entities as opposed to as part of an integrated
          telecommunications provider following completion of AT&T's
          restructuring plan, including the inability of these groups to rely on
          the financial and operational resources of the combined company and
          these groups having to provide services that were previously provided
          by a different part of the combined company,
 
 - -        the impact of existing and new competitors in the markets in which
          these groups compete, including competitors that may offer less
          expensive products and services, desirable or innovative products,
          technological substitutes, or have extensive resources or
          better financing.
 
 - -        the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting from excessive
          deployment of network capacity,
 
 - -        the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in the
          telecommunications industry, which trend may have the effect of making
          the competitors of these entities larger and better financed and afford
          these competitors with extensive resources and greater geographic
          reach, allowing them to compete more effectively,
 
 - -        the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which the company
          operates, which may decrease prices charged, increase churn and change
          customer mix, profitability and average revenue per user,
 
 - -        the ability to enter into agreements to provide, and the cost of
          entering new markets necessary to provide, nationwide services,
 
 - -        the ability to establish a significant market presence in new
          geographic and service markets,
 
 - -        the availability and cost of capital and the consequences of
          increased leverage,
 <PAGE>   41
 - -        the successful execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic assets as
          part of an overall corporate deleveraging plan,
 
 - -        the potential impact of NTT DoCoMo's investment in AT&T, including
          provisions of the agreements that restrict AT&T Wireless Group's future
          operations, and provisions that may require AT&T to repurchase NTT
          DoCoMo's interest in AT&T if AT&T or AT&T Wireless Group fail to meet
          specified conditions,
 
 - -        the impact of any unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of
          the business strategies of the company,
 
 - -        the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to
          competitors by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or state
          regulatory commissions under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or
          other applicable laws and regulations,
 
 - -        the risks and costs associated with the need to acquire additional
          wireless spectrum for current and future services,
 
 - -        the risks associated with technological requirements, technology
          substitution and changes and other technological developments,
 
 - -        the results of litigation filed or to be filed against the company,
 
 - -        the possibility of one or more of the markets in which the company
          competes being impacted by changes in political, economic or other
          factors, such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other
          external factors over which these groups have no control, and
 
 - -        the risks related to AT&T's investments in LMG and joint ventures.

 The discussion and analysis that follows provides information management
 believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of AT&T's consolidated
 results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, and financial
 condition as of March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 The comparison of first quarter 2001 results with the first quarter of 2000 was
 impacted by events, such as acquisitions and dispositions, that occurred during
 these two years. For example, at year-end 2000, we acquired the wireless
 property in Los Angeles as a result of the AB Cellular redemption of AT&T's
 equity interest in AB Cellular. Prior to that date, AT&T held a 55.62% equity
 interest in AB cellular with 50% voting interest and recorded the investment
 under the equity method of accounting. The consolidation of the Los Angeles
 property resulted in the inclusion of 100% of its results in each line item of
 AT&T's Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2000 and the results were also
 included in AT&T's Consolidated Income Statements starting January 2001. In
 addition, in 2000, we acquired MediaOne and wireless properties in the San
 Francisco Bay area, which were both included in our first quarter 2001 results,
 but were not included in the first quarter 2000 results.
 
 Year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of At Home
 Corp. (Excite@Home) beginning September 1, 2000, due to corporate-governance
 changes, which gave AT&T a controlling interest. At that time and on March 31,
 2001, we had an approximate 23% economic interest and 74% voting interest in
 Excite@Home. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusion of 100%
 of its results in each line item of AT&T's Consolidated Balance Sheet and
 Consolidated Income Statement. The approximate 77% we do not own is reflected in
 the March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Consolidated Balance Sheets within
 "Minority Interest" and as a component of "Minority interest income (expense)"
 in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months ended March 31,
 2001. For the three months ended March 31, 2000, our ownership interest in
 Excite@Home was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with
 earnings or losses included as a component of "Net losses from other equity
 investments" in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
 Effectively July 1, 2000, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) eliminated
 Primary Interexchange Carrier Charges (PICC or per-line charges) that AT&T pays
 for residential and single-line businesses. The elimination of these per-line
 charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue, since AT&T
 has historically billed its customers for these charges.

 </TABLE>
 
 Total revenue increased 5.4%, or $0.9 billion, in the first quarter of 2001
 compared with the prior year period. Approximately $1.0 billion of the increase
 is due to the impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home
 partially offset by the elimination of PICC and dispositions. Also contributing
 to the revenue growth was Wireless Services, data and Internet protocol (IP)
 growth within Business Services and Broadband. These increases were largely
 offset by the accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue. We expect
 long distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing
 competition and product substitution.
 
 Revenue by segment is discussed in more detail in the segment results section.

 Costs of services and products increased $0.9 billion, or 23.6%, in the first
 quarter of 2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. Approximately $0.7
 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions, primarily MediaOne, net of
 dispositions, and the impact of consolidating Excite@Home. The higher costs
 associated with new outsourcing contracts as well as our growing wireless
 subscriber base increased expenses by approximately $0.2 billion. The higher
 wireless expenses primarily related to higher costs of handsets sold due to an
 increase in gross subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001 compared
 with the same period in the prior year.

 Access and other connection expenses decreased 8.4%, to $3.3 billion in the
 first quarter of 2001, compared with $3.6 billion in the first quarter of 2000.
 Included within access and other connection expenses are costs that we pay to
 connect calls on the facilities of other service providers. Mandated reductions
 in per-minute access costs and decreased per-line charges effective in the
 second half of 2000 resulted in lower costs of approximately $0.5 billion. These
 decreases were partially offset by approximately $0.2 billion of higher costs
 due to volume increases, as well as higher Universal Service Fund contributions.
 Since most of these charges are passed through to the customer, the per-minute
 access-rate and per-line charge reductions and the Universal Service Fund
 contributions have generally resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue.

 Increased marketing, advertising and customer care in support of our growing
 Wireless and Broadband businesses drove approximately $0.3 billion of the
 increase. In addition, $0.4 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions,
 primarily MediaOne, net of dispositions, and the impact of consolidating
 Excite@Home. Partially offsetting these increases was cost savings of
 approximately $0.2 billion as a result of continued cost-control initiatives,
 primarily from our Consumer Services Business.

 base resulting from continued infrastructure investment, and the remaining
 increase resulted from acquisitions activity, primarily MediaOne. Capital
 expenditures were $3.3 billion for the first quarter of 2001 compared with $2.8
 billion for the same period in 2000. The primary focus for capital expenditures
 in 2001 continues to be on the core growth areas of wireless, broadband, data
 and IP, and local.

 Net restructuring and other charges             $808      $773
 </TABLE>
 
 During the first quarter of 2001, AT&T recorded $808 million of net
 restructuring and other charges, which had an approximate $0.21 impact on basic
 and diluted earnings per share. Included in these charges was $739 million for
 asset impairment charges related to Excite@Home, and $69 for restructuring and
 exit costs which consisted of $59 million for cash severance costs, $6 million
 related to facilities and $4 million related to termination of lease
 obligations.
 
 The asset impairment charges included $600 recorded by Excite@Home associated
 with goodwill impairment of various acquisitions, primarily Excite, and a
 related goodwill impairment charge of $139 recorded by AT&T associated with its
 acquisition goodwill of Excite@Home. The impairment resulted from the continued
 weakness of the online media market that Excite@Home operates in. Since we
 consolidate, but only own approximately 23% of Excite@Home, 77% of the charge
 recorded by Excite@Home was not included as a reduction to AT&T's net income,
 but rather eliminated in our March 31, 2001 Consolidated Statement of Income as
 "Minority interest income (expense)."
 
 The $59 million of cash severance costs were primarily recorded as a result of
 synergies created by the MediaOne merger related to approximately 2,350
 employees. Approximately 10% of the individuals were management employees and
 90% were non-management employees. Nearly 88% of the affected employees have
 left their positions as of March 31, 2001, and the remaining employees will
 leave the company by the end of 2001.
 
 This restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of
 approximately $42 million in 2001 (net of severance benefit pay-outs of
 approximately $59 million) and approximately $132 million per year thereafter,
 as well as EBIT savings of approximately $97 million in 2001 and approximately
 $101 million per year thereafter. We expect increased spending in growth
 businesses will largely offset these cash and EBIT savings. The EBIT savings,
 primarily attributable to reduced personnel-related expenses, will be realized
 in costs of services and products and SG&A expenses.
 
 In the second quarter of 2001, we expect to incur additional restructuring
 charges resulting from MediaOne synergies and work force reductions at
 Excite@Home.
 
 During the first quarter of 2000, AT&T recorded $773 million of net
 restructuring and other charges, which included $682 million for restructuring
 and exit costs associated with AT&T's initiative to reduce costs by the end of
 2000, and $91 million related to the government-mandated disposition of AT&T
 Communications (U.K.) Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert.
 <PAGE>   45
 Included in restructuring and exit costs was $458 million of cash termination
 benefits associated with the involuntary separation of approximately 6,200
 employees. Approximately one-half of the individuals were management employees
 and one-half were non-management employees. Nearly 60% of the affected employees
 have left their positions as of March 31, 2001, and the remaining employees will
 leave the company during 2001.
 
 We also recorded $62 million of network lease and other contract termination
 costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying vendors of the
 termination of these contracts during the quarter.
 
 Also included in restructuring and exit costs was $144 of benefit curtailment
 costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit plans. We also
 recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 related to the write-down of
 unrecoverable assets in certain businesses in which the carrying value is no
 longer supported by future cash flows.

 Operating income decreased $1.4 billion, or 59.4%, in the first quarter of 2001
 compared with the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to the
 impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home, which lowered
 operating income by nearly $1.1 billion. A majority of the impact of operating
 losses and the restructuring charge generated by Excite@Home was offset in
 minority interest income (expense), reflecting the approximate 77% of
 Excite@Home we do not own. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income
 was the impact of lower revenue in Consumer Services, and higher operating
 expenses for advanced Broadband services, including digital video, high-speed
 data and broadband telephony, partially offset by restructuring charges, net of
 asset impairment, recorded in the first quarter of 2000.

 Other (expense) income for the first quarter of 2001 was an expense of $2.4
 billion, compared with income of $0.7 billion in the first quarter of 2000, an
 increase in expense of $3.1 billion. Effective January 1, 2001, in conjunction
 with the adoption of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
 Hedging Activities," we reclassified certain investment securities, which
 support debt that is indexed to those securities, from "available-for-sale" to
 "trading." As a result of the reclassification, we recorded a pretax charge of
 $2.6 billion. Also contributing to the increase in expense were lower net gains
 on sale of businesses and investments of approximately $0.4 billion.

 </TABLE>
 
 Interest expense increased 64.6%, or $0.4 billion, in first quarter of 2001
 compared with the same period in 2000. The increase was primarily due to the
 higher average debt balance as a result of our June 2000 acquisition of
 MediaOne, including outstanding debt of MediaOne and debt issued to fund the
 MediaOne acquisition and debt issuance by AT&T Wireless in the quarter.

 (Benefit) provision for income taxes           $(335)     $509
 </TABLE>
 <PAGE>   46
 The (benefit) provision for income taxes was a benefit of $0.3 billion in the
 first quarter of 2001 compared with an expense of $0.5 billion in the first
 quarter of 2000. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a net loss before
 income taxes in the first quarter of 2001, compared with earnings before income
 taxes in the first quarter of 2000. The effective tax rate for the quarter was
 13.9%, compared with 20.5% for the first quarter of 2000. The first quarter 2001
 effective tax rate was impacted by a charge associated with the adoption of SFAS
 No. 133, as well as a non tax-deductible asset impairment charge recorded
 related to Excite@Home. The first quarter of 2001 effective tax rate was also
 negatively impacted by the consolidation of operational losses of Excite@Home,
 which is unable to record tax benefits on its pretax losses, and higher non
 tax-deductible goodwill amortization. The first quarter 2000 effective tax rate
 was positively impacted by a tax-free gain resulting from an exchange of AT&T
 stock for an entity owning certain cable-systems and other assets with Cox, and
 the benefit of the write-off of the related deferred tax liability.

 Minority interest income (expense)              $650      $(44)
 </TABLE>
 
 Minority interest income (expense), which is recorded net of income taxes,
 represents an adjustment to AT&T's income to reflect the less than 100%
 ownership of consolidated subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
 issued by subsidiaries of AT&T. The $0.7 billion decrease in minority interest
 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, as compared with the corresponding
 prior-year period resulted from the consolidation of Excite@Home effective
 September 1, 2000. The minority interest income in 2001 primarily reflects
 losses generated by Excite@Home, including an asset impairment charge that were
 attributable to the approximate 77% of Excite@Home not owned by AT&T. The income
 tax benefit recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $87 million and
 $26 million for the first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 </TABLE>
 
 Equity losses from LMG, which are recorded net of income taxes , were $0.7
 billion in the first quarter of 2001, compared with earnings of $0.9 billion for
 the same period in 2000. The decline was primarily due to lower gains on
 dispositions, including gains associated with the mergers of various companies
 that LMG had investments in. Gains were recorded for the difference between the
 carrying value of LMG's interest in the acquired company and the fair value of
 securities received in the merger. In addition, the impairment charges recorded
 on LMG's investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value also
 contributed to the decline. These were partially offset by tax benefits recorded
 in the quarter associated with the net loss before cumulative accounting
 change compared with tax expense in the prior year quarter associated with
 net earnings.

 Net losses from other equity investments, which were recorded net of income
 taxes, were $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2001, a 27.0% decrease compared
 with the first quarter of 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the
 consolidation of Excite@Home and higher earnings related to Cablevision Systems
 Corp. reflecting a gain associated with the swap of cable properties, partially
 offset by higher losses from its normal business operations. Partially
 offsetting these decreases were higher equity losses from various investments
 <PAGE>   47
 including Concert, as well as equity earnings in the first quarter of 2000 from
 investments sold in 2000. The income tax benefit recorded on net losses from
 other equity investments were $102 million and $115 million for the first
 quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2000, respectively.

 </TABLE>
 
 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, was
 $1.4 billion, in the first quarter of 2001 for AT&T Group. It represented fair
 value adjustments of debt instruments including those acquired in conjunction
 with the MediaOne merger, as well as to our warrant portfolio due to the
 adoption of SFAS No. 133. In addition, we also reclassified certain investment
 securities, which support debt that is indexed to those securities, from
 "available-for-sale" to "trading." The impact of reclassification was recorded
 as a reduction to other income.
 
 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, was
 $0.5 billion, for Liberty Media Group in the first quarter of 2001. The increase
 was primarily due to separately recording the embedded call option obligations
 associated with LMG's senior exchangeable debentures.

 Losses per diluted share attributable to the AT&T Common Stock Group were $0.10
 in the first quarter of 2001 compared with EPS on a diluted basis of $0.54 in
 the first quarter of 2000. The decrease was primarily driven by lower operating
 income, lower gains on the sales of businesses and investments, and the net
 impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133, which includes a 0.42 per share charge
 relating to the revaluation of certain securities reclassified from
 "available-for-sale" to "trading" and a benefit of $0.36 per share relating to
 the cumulative effect of adoption. Also contributing to the decrease in earnings
 was increased interest expense, partially offset by higher minority
 interest income.
 
 Losses per diluted share attributable to Liberty Media Group (LMG) were $0.06 in
 the first quarter of 2001, compared with earnings of $0.37 on a diluted basis,
 in the first quarter of 2000. The decline was primarily due to lower gains on
 dispositions, including gains associated with the mergers of various companies
 that LMG had investments in. Gains were recorded for the difference between the
 carrying value of LMG's interest in the acquired company and the fair value of
 securities received in the merger. In addition, the impairment charges recorded
 on LMG's investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value also
 contributed to the decline. These were partially offset tax benefits recorded in
 the quarter associated with the net loss before cumulative accounting change
 compared with tax expense in the prior year quarter associated with net earnings
 as well as by the cumulative effect of the accounting changes due to the
 adoption of SFAS 133.
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS
 
 In support of the services we provide, we segment our results by the business
 units that support our primary lines of business: Business Services, Consumer
 Services, Wireless Services and Broadband. The balance of AT&T's operations,
 excluding LMG is included in a Corporate and Other category. Although not a
 segment, we also discuss the results of LMG.
 
 The discussion of segment results includes revenue; EBIT (earnings before
 interest, taxes, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and dividend
 requirements on preferred stock); EBITDA [EBIT excluding depreciation and
 amortization, and minority interest (expense) income other than Excite@Home's
 minority (expense) interest]; total assets, and capital additions. The
 discussion of EBITDA for Wireless Services and Broadband is modified to exclude
 other income and net losses from equity investments. Total assets for each
 segment generally include all assets, except intercompany receivables. However,
 our Wireless Services segment included intercompany receivables from AT&T and
 the related interest income since these assets relate to the results of the AT&T
 Wireless Group tracked business. Prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or
 leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level, and therefore are
 included in the Corporate and Other group. Capital additions for each segment
 include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, acquisitions of
 licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
 and additions to internal-use software.
 
 EBIT is the primary measure used by AT&T's chief operating decision makers to
 measure AT&T's operating results and to measure segment profitability and
 performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as earnings before interest, taxes, the
 cumulative effect of accounting changes and dividend requirements on preferred
 stock. In addition, management also uses EBITDA as a measure of segment
 profitability and performance, and is defined as EBIT, excluding depreciation
 and amortization, minority interest (expense) income other than Excite@Home's
 minority (expense) interest. Interest and taxes are not factored into the
 <PAGE>   49
 segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision makers;
 therefore, trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis.
 Management believes EBIT is meaningful to investors because it provides analysis
 of operating results using the same measures used by AT&T's chief operating
 decision makers and provides a return on total capitalization measure. We
 believe EBITDA is meaningful to investors as a measure of each segment's
 liquidity consistent with the measure utilized by our chief operating decision
 makers. In addition, we believe that both EBIT and EBITDA allow investors a
 means to evaluate the financial results of each segment in relation to total
 AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was deficit of $1.1 billion and earning of $2.7 billion for
 the quarters ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. EBITDA for AT&T was
 $1.9 billion and $4.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
 2000, respectively. Our calculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be
 consistent with the calculation of these measures by other public companies.
 EBIT and EBITDA should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally
 accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of
 performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
 as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into account
 changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which
 can affect cash flow.
 
 In connection with our corporate restructuring program set forth in late 2000,
 our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes enacted since the
 publication of our 2000 annual results. The changes are as follows: The Business
 Services segment was expanded to include the results of international operations
 and ventures. In addition, certain corporate costs that were previously recorded
 within the Corporate and Other Group have been allocated to the respective
 segments in an effort to ultimately have the results of these businesses reflect
 all direct corporate costs as well as overhead for shared services. All prior
 period results have been restated to reflect these changes. Total assets for our
 reportable segments generally include all asset, except intercompany
 receivables. However, our Wireless Services Segment included intercompany
 receivables from AT&T and the related interest income since these assets relate
 to the results of the AT&T Wireless Group tracked businesses.
 
 Reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continuously review our management
 model and structure, which may result in additional adjustments to our operating
 segments in the future. In addition, when we create tracking stocks for our
 Consumer and Broadband units, we will begin allocating `pure' corporate overhead
 to these units. See note (b) for further detail on our restructuring plan.
 
 BUSINESS SERVICES
 
 Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications
 services, including long distance, local, and data and IP networking to small
 and medium-sized businesses, large domestic and multinational businesses and
 government agencies. Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IP
 transport to service resellers (wholesale services).
 
 Business Services includes AT&T Solutions, the company's professional-services
 outsourcing business, which provides seamless solutions that maximize the
 competitive advantage of networking-based electronic applications for global
 clients. AT&T Solutions also provides e-infrastructure and high-availability
 services to enterprise clients, and manages AT&T's unified global network.
 Business Services also includes the results of International ventures
 and operations.
