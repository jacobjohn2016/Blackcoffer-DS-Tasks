 Total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 1994 were essentially level
 with the first quarter of fiscal year 1993 after consideration of the foreign
 exchange translation impact of approximately $2 million.  COM systems revenues,
 however, were up $2.3 million, or 16%, over the prior year on strong XFP
 shipments.  Micrographics service and maintenance service revenues were each up
 3%.  Micrographic supplies revenues were off $6.8 million, or 13% principally
 due to decreased duplicate film and reader printer sales in the OEM channels.
 
 Service revenues generated a gross profit margin of 32% in the first quarter up
 from 31% in the prior year first quarter.  Equipment and supply sales generated
 a gross profit margin of 30% compared to 29% in the prior year.  The improved
 margins result largely from the cost reduction efforts launched in the third
 quarter of fiscal year 1993.
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 16% of total revenues
 in both periods.
 
 The first quarter financial statements reflect the Company's adoption of the
 Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
 Taxes", as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
 December 31, 1993 Balance Sheet includes a $34,667,000 deferred tax asset and
 the Consolidated Statements of Operations include a $8,000,000 one time
 adjustment reflecting the cumulative effect on prior years.

 Working capital amounted to $35.5 million at December 31, 1993 compared to
 $30.9 million at September 30, 1993.  As disclosed in the Consolidated
 Statements of Cash Flows, net cash used in operating activities improved $7.4
 in the first quarter of fiscal year 1994 compared to the first quarter of
 fiscal 1993, primarily due to reductions in working capital.  Net cash used in
 financing activities was reduced $22.3 million dollars reflecting lower
 paydowns on the Company's revolving line of credit and resulting in the year to
 year increase in cash balances of $21.0 million.  The Company believes that
 operating cash flow in 1994 will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for
 capital expenditures, debt repayments, and other obligations.
