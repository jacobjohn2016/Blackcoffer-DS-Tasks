                      CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
      This report contains forward-looking statements.  Additional written or
 oral forward-looking statements may be made by AMERCO from time to time in
 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise.  Management
 believes such forward-looking statements are within the meaning of the safe-
 harbor provisions.  Such statements may include, but not be limited to,
 projections of revenues, income or loss, estimates of capital expenditures,
 litigation results, plans for future operations, products or services and
 financing needs or plans, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing.
 The words "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "estimate", "project" and
 similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which speak only as
 of the date the statement was made.  Forward-looking statements are inherently
 subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or
 quantified.  Future events and actual results could differ materially from
 those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking
 statements.  The following disclosures, as well as other statements in this
 report and in the Notes to AMERCO's Consolidated Financial Statements,
 describe factors, among others, that could contribute to or cause such
 differences, or that could affect AMERCO's stock price.
 
 REVISED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
      We restated our unaudited financial statements as of and for the period
 ended December 31, 2000, reported under Part I, Item I, Financial Statements
 to correct two errors.  The first error related to the capitalization of fixed
 assets.  In the normal course of business, AMERCO capitalized fixed asset
 betterments.  In the fourth quarter, it was determined that certain betterments
 had been erroneously capitalized twice.  The second error related to a deferred
 gain in connection with fixed assets production recorded throughout the year.
 AMERCO determined that a portion of the deferred gain recorded in the third
 quarter was incorrect.  The following represents the as previously reported
 and as amended amounts as of and for the period ending December 31, 2000.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 VERSUS NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues, net sales and investment and
 interest income.  Total rental revenue was $951.1 million and $907.8 million
 for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net
 revenues from the rental of moving related equipment increased by $35.8 million.
 This increase is primarily attributable to higher truck and trailer rental
 revenues.  Storage revenues increased $8.2 million due to increases in rates
 and in the number of storage rooms rented.
 
      Net sales revenues were $155.1 million and $148.7 million for the nine
 months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth
 resulted from the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.), which led
 to the majority of the increase, and from an increase in the sale of hitches.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $22.4 million and $15.0 million
 for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 increase is due to increased investments.
 
      Cost of sales was $87.6 million and $87.7 million for the nine months
 ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations were $743.8 million
 and $721.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Increased expenditure levels for personnel and rental equipment
 maintenance, due to an increase in truck rental transactions and in fleet size,
 were primarily responsible.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $59.8 million and $54.8 million for the nine
 months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase reflects
 depreciation on the rental truck fleet.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $102.5 million
 and $98.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.
 <PAGE> 23
 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $54.1 million and
 $55.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Intercompany revenue was $52.6 million and $53.1 million for
 the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $7.8 million and $5.7 million
 for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This
 increase correlates to an increase in investments in notes and mortgages.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $9.7 million and $6.8 million for the nine
 months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase is due to
 the build out of storage facilities.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $10.5
 million and $18.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease reflects increases in lease expenses.
 
 Property and Casualty
      RepWest's premiums were $135.7 million and $100.3 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  General agency
 premiums were $37.5 million and $11.6 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Assumed treaty reinsurance
 premium was $50.5 million and $35.0 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Rental industry revenue was
 $28.2 million and $35.6 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2000
 and 1999, respectively.  This change was caused by the restructuring of the
 rental industry Business Auto General Liability Policy.
 
      Net investment income was $23.7 million and $24.8 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The reduction is
 attributable to decreased gains and decreased invested assets.
 
      Benefits and losses were $116.4 million and $82.4 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase is due
 to new agency programs in Non-Standard Auto and Transportation, as well as in
 assumed treaty reinsurance business.
 
      The amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) was $10.1 million
 and $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.
 
      Operating expenses were $37.8 million and $23.4 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is a
 result of commissions on new agency business premium writings as well as
 assumed reinsurance treaties, increased personnel expenses and changes in
 claims handling procedures.
 
      Operating profit (loss) before tax and intercompany elimination was
 $(4.9) million and $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000
 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease is the result of additional incurred
 losses and operating expense, and decreased investment income, offset by an
 increase in earned premiums.
 <PAGE> 24
 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $78.3 million and $71.5 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The difference was
 primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in the credit insurance lines and a
 $4.1 million increase in the Medicare supplement line.  Premiums related to
 other health insurance products increased $0.4 million.  Earned premiums from
 life insurance and annuitizations decreased $0.2 million.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $18.2 million
 and $16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The increase was due to improved interest rate spreads on the
 interest sensitive products and a larger invested asset base.
 
      Benefits were $54.2 million and $44.6 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Medicare supplement benefits
 increased $6.4 million from 1999 and credit insurance benefits increased $2.0
 million from 1999.  Other health insurance benefits increased $1.6 million for
 the year primarily from one-time charges and poor group disability experience.
 Annuity benefits increased $0.8 million from 1999.  The life insurance lines
 have had better mortality experience in 2000, resulting in a $1.2 million
 decrease in benefits from 1999.
 
      Amortization of DAC was $15.0 million and $17.2 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease is due
 to credit reinsurance.
 
      Operating expenses were $19.9 million and $15.5 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is due
 to premium volume increases.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was $7.4 million
 and $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease is due to loss ratios on the Medicare supplement
 business and Credit insurance business.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $65.3 million and $61.0 million for the nine months
 ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase can be attributed
 to increases in the average debt outstanding and in the average cost of debt.
 
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $92.7 million
 and $116.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  After providing for income taxes, net earnings from operations
 were $59.7 million and $75.1 million for the nine months ended December 31,
 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Following deductions for an extraordinary loss
 from the early extinguishment of debt, net earnings were $57.6 million and
 $75.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.

 interest income.  Total rental revenue was $270.8 million and $264.8 million
 for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net revenues
 from the rental of moving related equipment increased by $4.0 million. This
 increase is primarily attributable to higher truck and trailer rental revenues.
 Storage revenues increased $2.0 million due to increases in rates and in the
 number of storage rooms rented.
 
      Net sales revenues was $41.1 million and $38.5 million for the quarters
 ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth resulted from
 the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.) which led to the majority
 of the increase during the quarter.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $8.9 million and $5.2 million for
 the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is

 December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany elimination were $252.0 million
 and $244.6 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The increase reflects higher personnel and rental equipment
 maintenance expenditures associated with an increase in truck rental
 transactions and inventory levels.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $20.6 million and $20.8 million for the
 quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

 $18.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Intercompany revenue remained constant at $17.8 million for the quarters ended
 December 31, 2000 and 1999.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $2.8 million and $0.9 million for
 the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase
 correlates to an increase in investments in notes and mortgages.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $4.4 million and $2.2 million for the
 quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $2.4 million
 and $4.5 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease reflects increases in lease expenses.
 <PAGE> 26
 Property and Casualty
      RepWest's premiums were $63.4 million and $35.7 million for the quarters
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is directly
 related to general agency premiums, which were $17.3 million and $3.4 million
 for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Assumed
 treaty reinsurance premium were $27.5 million and $14.1 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Net investment income was $8.0 million and $8.1 million for the quarters
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Benefits and losses incurred were $56.3 million and $28.7 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is a
 result of new general agency business writings in Non-Standard Auto and
 Transportation, as well as in assumed treaty reinsurance business.
 
      The amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) was $3.8 million and
 $3.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The increase is due to the increase in new business.
 
      Operating expenses were $18.0 million and $7.8 million for the quarters
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The change is due to
 increased commission expense resulting from new agency business premium
 writings on Non Standard Auto and Transportation coverages, as well as assumed
 treaty business.  General and administrative expenses also increased due to an
 increase in personnel and overhead required to support new business expansion.
 
      Operating profit (loss) before tax and intercompany elimination was
 $(6.8) million and $4.1 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and
 1999, respectively.  This decrease is the result of increased incurred losses
 and operating expense, offset by an increase in earned premiums.
 <PAGE> 27
 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $26.8 million and $24.3 million for the quarters ended
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The change is primarily due to a
 $0.3 million increase in the credit insurance line and a $1.5 million increase
 in the Medicare supplement line.  Annuitizations and premiums from other health
 and life insurance products increased $0.7 million.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations remained constant
 at $5.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999.
 
      Benefits were $18.5 million and $14.3 million for the quarters ended
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Medicare supplement benefits
 increased $2.7 million from 1999 due to higher loss ratios.  Other health
 insurance benefits increased $0.9 million due to poor group disability
 experience.  Annuity benefits increased $0.6 million.
 
      Amortization of DAC was $4.8 million and $6.1 million for the quarters
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Amortization from annuities
 decreased $0.5 million, other health insurance amortization decreased $0.2
 million and the credit insurance amortization decreased $0.6 million for the
 quarter.
 
      Operating expenses were $6.6 million and $5.9 million for the quarters
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase included
 $1.6 million in Medical Supplement commissions to agents, partially offset by
 a decrease of $0.8 million in administration costs and surrender charge income
 of $0.2 million.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was $2.6 million
 and $3.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease is due to loss ratios on the Medicare supplement
 business.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was unchanged at $21.2 million for the quarters ended
 December 31, 2000 and 1999.
 
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax loss was $29.4 million and $14.8
 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 After providing for income taxes, net loss from operations was $19.2 million
 and $9.3 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Following deductions for an extraordinary loss from the early
 extinguishment of debt, net loss was $21.3 million and $9.3 million for the
 quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 <PAGE> 28
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul maintains a large inventory of
 rental items.  In the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, capital
 expenditures were $280.3 million and $269.5 million, respectively.  These
 expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck fleet.  The
 capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained through internally
 generated funds from operations and through lease financings.
 
      Cash provided (used) by operating activities was ($33.2) million and
 $128.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in receivables.
 
      At December 31, 2000, total outstanding notes and loans payable was
 $1,182.1 million as compared to $1,137.8 million at March 31, 2000.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $77.6 million and $6.3 million
 for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 increase resulted from an increase in accounts payable.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Cash provided (used) by operating activities was $20.3 million and
 $(9.2) million for nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 This change resulted from increases in unearned premium, funds withheld and
 decreased accounts receivable from December 1999 to September 2000.  The
 increase was offset by a decrease in loss and loss adjusting expense reserves
 from December 1999 to September 2000 and decreased net income.
 
      RepWest's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio
 were $12.0 million and $1.4 million at September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The increase is a result of $5.4 million in short-term assets
 that were on hand at September 2000 to cover a pending securities settlement.
 In addition, short-term assets were increased during the period due to
 increased claim payments generated by new business.
 
      RepWest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily
 in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-income securities
 consisting of investment grade securities.  The maturity distribution is
 designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current
 liquidity remains strong with current invested assets equal to 97.2% of total
 liabilities.
 
      The liability for reported and unreported losses is based upon company
 historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based
 on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.  Unpaid
 loss and loss expenses are not discounted.
 <PAGE> 29
 Life Insurance
      Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest-
 sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of cash are
 operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching the
 investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being
 written is an important consideration.
 
      Cash provided (used) by operating activities was ($0.3) million and $5.6
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease is due to higher benefit payouts in relation to collected
 premium.  Cash provided (used) by financing activities was $7.1 million and
 ($0.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The increase is due to a better ratio of annuity deposits
 to withdrawals.
 
      In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a
 substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-term
 portfolio. Short-term investments were $59.7 million and $52.1 million for
 the nine months ending September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Management
 believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable
 cash needs.
 
 Consolidated Group
      During each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
 AMERCO estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately
 $313 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.  This level of
 capital expenditures, combined with an average of approximately $72 million
 in annual long-term debt maturities during this same period, are expected to
 create annual average funding needs of approximately $385 million.
 
 Credit Agreements
      AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured
 medium-term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and
 foreign banks.  Principally to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers,
 AMERCO routinely enters into sale and leaseback transactions.  As of
 December 31, 2000, AMERCO had $1,182.1 million in total notes and loans
 payable outstanding and unutilized lines of credit of approximately
 $67.2 million.
 
      Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
 other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
 additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing
 certain additional liens on its properties, assets and restricting the
 issuance of certain types of preferred stock.  At December 31, 2000, AMERCO
 was in compliance with these covenants.
 
      Reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 in AMERCO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000
 for additional information about AMERCO's credit agreements.
