 
                   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
 OVERVIEW
 
 On April 27, 2000,  AT&T completed an initial public  offering of 15.6%,  or 360
 million  shares,  of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an initial public
 offering  price of  $29.50  per  share.  This  stock is  designed  to track  the
 performance  of AT&T's  wireless  services  businesses.  The AT&T Wireless Group
 tracking stock issued in the initial public offering reflected only a portion of
 the economic  interest of the AT&T Wireless  Group.  AT&T retained the remaining
 interest in the economic  performance  of the AT&T Wireless Group in the form of
 an inter-group  interest  which  represented an 84.4% interest as of the date of
 the initial public  offering and at June 30, 2000. The results  included  herein
 represent the AT&T Wireless Group in its entirety for all periods presented. For
 the  portion  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results  attributed  to the public
 shareholders,  see AT&T's  Form  10-Q.  AT&T  currently  intends to dispose of a
 portion of the remaining  interest in the AT&T Wireless Group in the second half
 of this year.  Such  disposition  will include a  distribution  in the form of a
 dividend  to AT&T  Common  Stock  Group  (which  represents  the results of AT&T
 excluding the results  attributable to tracking stocks) shareowners for at least
 a portion of such  interest,  but may also include an exchange  offer, a further
 sale of the AT&T Wireless  Group tracking  stock or a combination  thereof.  The
 method,  timing and sequence of the distribution  options,  which could occur in
 stages,  will be based on the AT&T Board of Directors'  assessment of the market
 conditions and other circumstances,  as appropriate, with the goal of maximizing
 value for all AT&T  shareowners.  Following the  distribution we expect that the
 outstanding  shares of the AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock will reflect 100%
 of the economic performance of the AT&T Wireless Group.
 
 The AT&T Wireless  Group is a fully  integrated  business unit of AT&T. The AT&T
 Wireless  Group  includes  the  results  of  its  mobility  and  fixed  wireless
 businesses, as well as its international operations, which primarily include the
 earnings or losses  associated with equity interests in  international  wireless
 communications ventures and partnerships.
 
 In June 2000,  the AT&T Wireless  Group closed the  acquisition of the remaining
 50%  partnership  interest they previously did not own in CMT Partners (Bay Area
 Properties). The Bay Area Properties cover a population base exceeding 7 million
 potential  customers  and,  as  of  June  30,  2000,  served  nearly  1  million
 subscribers.  The  acquisition of this entity was announced in conjunction  with
 the signing of agreements to purchase wireless systems in Houston and San Diego,
 which are anticipated to close later this year. The three systems combined cover
 a population of approximately 15 million potential customers and, as of June 30,
 2000, served more than 1.3 million subscribers.  Also in June, the AT&T Wireless
 Group  completed its acquisition of Wireless One Network,  L.P.  (Wireless One).
 Wireless  One owns and operates  wireless  systems in  northwest  and  southwest
 Florida  covering a population base of 1.6 million  potential  customers and had
 approximately  190,000  subscribers as of June 30, 2000. In February 2000,  AT&T
 and  Dobson  Communications  Corporation,  through  a  joint  venture,  acquired
 American  Cellular  Corporation.  AT&T  contributed  its  interest  in the joint
 venture  to the AT&T  Wireless  Group as of the  date of the  acquisition.  This
 acquisition  increased the AT&T Wireless  Group's coverage in New York State and
 several midwest markets by adding approximately 450,000 subscribers.

 COMBINED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH  PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE THREE
 AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 1999
 Revenue
 
 Total revenue  includes  wireless voice and data services,  the sale of handsets
 and accessories,  and revenue  associated with the aviation  communications  and
 fixed wireless  operations.  The AT&T Wireless Group records revenue as services
 are provided or when the product is sold.  Services revenue  primarily  includes
 monthly recurring charges,  airtime and toll usage charges,  and roaming charges
 billed to  subscribers  for usage outside of the AT&T Wireless  Group network as
 well as  charges  billed to other  wireless  providers  for  roaming on the AT&T
 Wireless Group network.
 
 Total revenue  increased 31.9% to $2,477 million,  and increased 35.9% to $4,675
 million for the three and six month periods  ended June 30, 2000,  respectively,
 compared  with the  respective  prior year periods.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group's
 results  include  the  revenue  associated  with  Vanguard  Cellular  since  its
 acquisition  on May 3, 1999.  Total  revenue  increased  29.4% and 31.1% for the
 three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000, respectively, compared with the
 same  periods for 1999,  adjusted to exclude  Vanguard  Cellular  for the period
 January 2000 to April 2000, to correlate  results with 1999, due to the May 1999
 acquisition.
 
 The revenue  increases  were  primarily  due to growth in our mobility  business
 revenue,  driven by strong  consolidated  subscriber growth and continued rising
 average monthly revenue per user (ARPU). AT&T Digital One Rate service continues
 to contribute to the increase in ARPU and subscribers by acquiring and retaining
 high  value  customers,  who have a  significantly  higher  ARPU than an average
 subscriber.  As of June 30, 2000, the number of  subscribers  using AT&T Digital
 One Rate service was 2.4 million,  an increase of 66.2%,  compared with June 30,
 1999, of which nearly 73% were new  subscribers  to the AT&T Wireless  Group for
 the six months ended June 30, 2000.
 
 Services  revenue for the three month  period  ended June 30,  2000,  was $2,240
 million,  an increase of $551 million,  or 32.7%,  compared with the  respective
 period in 1999.  Services  revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2000,
 was $4,232 million, an increase of $1,171 million,  or 38.3%,  compared with the
 respective period in 1999.
 <PAGE>
 As of June 30,  2000,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group had 11.7  million  consolidated
 subscribers,  an increase of 33.8%, compared with the prior year, of which 85.1%
 were digital  subscribers,  up from 69.2% as of June 30, 1999. Included in these
 figures were nearly 1 million  subscribers  from our acquisition of the Bay Area
 Properties  in  June  2000  (which  were  previously   reported  as  partnership
 subscribers)  and  approximately  190,000  subscribers  from our  acquisition of
 Wireless One in June 2000. Net consolidated wireless subscriber additions in the
 second quarter  totaled  532,000,  a 14.2% increase over the prior year quarter.
 AT&T Wireless  Group's  average monthly churn rate in the second quarter of 2000
 was 2.7%  compared  with 2.3% in the second  quarter of 1999.  The AT&T Wireless
 Group's  average  monthly churn in the first half of 2000 was 2.8% compared with
 2.5% in the first half of 1999. Total subscribers, including partnership markets
 in which the AT&T  Wireless  Group  does not own a  controlling  interest,  were
 nearly 14  million at the end of the second  quarter of 2000,  a 22.3%  increase
 over the prior year. Ending total  subscribers  included  approximately  450,000
 subscribers  associated with the AT&T Wireless  Group's  acquisition of American
 Cellular in February 2000.
 
 The AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ARPU for the three  months  ended June 30, 2000 was
 $71.5,  an increase of $4.9, or 7.7%,  compared with the second quarter of 1999,
 and for the six months  ended June 30, 2000 was $69.4,  an increase of $5.7,  or
 8.9%,  compared with the first half of 1999.  These increases were primarily due
 to  increased  minutes of use per  subscriber,  driven in part by the  continued
 success  of AT&T  Digital  One Rate  service.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ARPU
 remained  significantly  higher than the wireless  industry  average  during the
 quarter and half year ended June 30, 2000, excluding the AT&T Wireless Group.
 
 Equipment  revenue  for the three month  period  ended June 30,  2000,  was $237
 million, an increase of $48 million, or 25.2%,  compared with the same period in
 1999.  Equipment  revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2000, was $443
 million, an increase of $63 million, or 16.6%,  compared with the same period in
 1999.  These  increases were primarily due to 30.8% and 29.2% increases in gross
 consolidated  subscriber additions in the three and six month periods ended June
 30, 2000,  respectively,  compared with the same periods in 1999. As an integral
 part of the wireless service  offering,  the AT&T Wireless Group supplies to its
 subscribers a selection of handsets at competitive  prices,  which are generally
 offered at or below cost.
 
 Costs of services and products
 
 Costs of services and products include the costs to place calls over the network
 (including the costs to operate and maintain the AT&T Wireless  Group's  network
 as well as  roaming  costs  paid to  other  wireless  providers),  the  costs of
 handsets and accessories provided to the AT&T Wireless Group's customers and the
 charges paid to connect calls on other networks, including those of AT&T.
 
 Costs of services and products  for the three and six month  periods  ended June
 30, 2000,  were $1,205  million and $2,258  million,  respectively.  This was an
 increase of $265  million,  or 28.3%,  for the three month period ended June 30,
 2000, and $508 million,  or 29.0%, for the six month period ended June 30, 2000,
 compared with the same periods in 1999.  These  increases  were due primarily to
 increases in the cost of handsets provided to subscribers which was attributable
 to a 30.8% and 29.2% increase,  respectively,  in gross subscriber additions for
 the three and six month  periods  ended June 30,  2000,  compared  with the same
 periods  in the prior  year.  Additionally,  growth in the  subscriber  base and
 increased  minutes  of usage  resulted  in an  increase  in the access and other
 connection  charges paid to connect calls on other networks,  including AT&T, as
 well as the costs to maintain the AT&T Wireless Group's network.
 
 Roaming  expenses  decreased 4.4% for the quarter ended June 30, 2000,  compared
 with the same period for 1999,  despite continued growth in off-network  roaming
 minutes.  The decrease in roaming expenses was driven primarily by a significant
 decrease  in the roaming  rate per minute of usage,  as well as  initiatives  to
 aggressively migrate more minutes onto the AT&T Wireless Group's network.
 <PAGE>
 Selling, general and administrative
 
 Selling,  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the three and six month
 periods ended June 30, 2000, were $763 million and $1,513 million, respectively,
 compared  with  $614  million  and  $1,178  million  for the three and six month
 periods ended June 30, 1999.  These  increases  were primarily  attributable  to
 higher  marketing and selling costs associated with the increase in consolidated
 subscriber additions in the second quarter and first half of 2000, compared with
 the respective  periods in 1999. Cost per gross subscriber  addition  (CPGA),
 which includes the cost of handset  subsidies  recorded in costs of services and
 products in the accompanying combined statement of operations, was $352 and $356
 for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000,  compared with $338 and
 $345 for the three and six month  periods  ended  June 30,  1999.  In  addition,
 growth in the wireless  customer  base  resulted in an increase in customer care
 and information technology expenses.
 
 Depreciation and amortization
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three month period ended June 30,
 2000, were $402 million, an increase of $94 million, or 30.5%, compared with the
 second quarter of 1999. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the six month
 period ended June 30, 2000, were $771 million,  an increase of $187 million,  or
 31.9%,  compared with the first half of 1999. These increases primarily resulted
 from the growth in the AT&T Wireless  Group's  depreciable  asset base resulting
 from  capital  expenditures  to increase the capacity of the network and improve
 call quality as well as the acquisition of Vanguard  Cellular in May 1999. Total
 capital  expenditures  were $1,291  million and $2,123 million for the three and
 six month periods ended June 30, 2000.
 
 Other income
 
 Other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges of assets,
 net equity earnings from investments,  intercompany  interest income on the note
 receivable from AT&T, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Other
 income for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000, was $227 million
 and $308 million, respectively. Other income for the three and six month periods
 ended June 30,  1999,  was $140  million  and $184  million,  respectively.  The
 increase  for the three and six  month  periods  ended  June 30,  2000,  was due
 primarily  to  higher  gains on the  sales  of  assets  as well as  intercompany
 interest income on the note receivable from AT&T of $67 million,  related to the
 attribution  of $7.0  billion of initial  public  offering  proceeds to the AT&T
 Wireless  Group.   Partially  offsetting  these  increases,  were  lower  equity
 earnings  primarily as a result of increased  losses  associated  with affiliate
 investments.
 
 Interest expense
 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest on intercompany debt due to AT&T
 less interest  expense  capitalized.  Interest expense for the second quarter of
 2000, was $18 million,  a decrease of $20 million,  or 51.6%,  compared with the
 second  quarter  of 1999.  Interest  expense  for the first half of 2000 was $69
 million,  a decrease of $1  million,  or 1.0%,  compared  with the first half of
 1999.  The decrease  for the second  quarter of 2000,  compared  with the second
 quarter of 1999, was due to higher levels of capitalized interest as a result of
 increased capital  expenditures,  as well as lower levels of average outstanding
 debt due to AT&T. The decrease in the average  outstanding  debt due to AT&T was
 attributable  to the  recapitalization  of $2.0 billion of long term debt due to
 AT&T  into 9%  cumulative  preferred  stock  subsequent  to the  initial  public
 offering  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock.  These  decreases  were
 partially offset by a higher rate of interest  charged on the intercompany  debt
 in the second quarter of 2000 versus the prior year quarter.  For the six months
 ended June 30, 2000,  higher  levels of  outstanding  debt,  as well as a higher
 interest rate, offset the increase in capitalized interest.
 <PAGE>
 Provision for income taxes
 
 The  provision  for income taxes for the three and six month  periods ended June
 30, 2000,  was $116 million and $146  million,  respectively,  compared with $43
 million and $17 million for the same periods in 1999, respectively. The increase
 in the  provision  for income taxes was due to higher income before income taxes
 and a higher  effective tax rate.  The effective  income tax rates for the three
 and six month  periods  ended June 30, 2000 were 36.9% and 39.3%,  respectively,
 <PAGE>
 compared with 35.5% and 35.3%, for the same periods in 1999,  respectively.  The
 effective income tax rate for each of the 2000 periods presented was impacted by
 the  amortization  of  intangibles  and  unutilized  equity  investment  losses,
 partially  offset  by a  benefit  due to the  disposition  of an  equity  method
 investment. The effective income tax rate for each of the 1999 periods presented
 was impacted by the benefit from the change in the valuation allowance and other
 estimates,  offset by  unutilized  foreign  equity  losses and  amortization  of
 intangibles.
 
 Dividend requirements on preferred stock held by AT&T
 
 At June 30, 2000, and December 31, 1999, the AT&T Wireless Group had outstanding
 $3.0 billion and $1.0  billion,  respectively,  of preferred  stock held by AT&T
 that pays dividends at 9% per annum.  Intercompany  indebtedness of $2.0 billion
 was  recapitalized  into an additional  $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred
 stock  following the initial  public  offering.  Dividend  requirements  on this
 preferred  stock for the three and six month periods  ended June 30, 2000,  were
 $33 million and $46 million,  respectively, and for the corresponding periods in
 1999 were $13 million and $27 million,  respectively, net of amounts recorded in
 accordance with the tax sharing agreement.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 The continued expansion of the AT&T Wireless Group's network, footprint and
 service offerings, and the marketing and distribution of its products and
 services, will continue to require substantial capital.  The AT&T Wireless Group
 has funded its operations by initial public  offering  proceeds  attributed from
 AT&T,  intercompany borrowings from AT&T and internally generated funds, as well
 as capital contributions from AT&T prior to the initial public offering. Capital
 contributions   from  AT&T  prior  to  the  initial  public  offering   included
 acquisitions  made by AT&T that have been attributed to the AT&T Wireless Group.
 Noncash  capital  contributions  from AT&T to the AT&T Wireless Group related to
 acquisitions  and initial  investments  funded by AT&T  totaled $539 million and
 $1,662  million  for the six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  2000  and  1999,
 respectively.
 
 The initial  public  offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted
 in net proceeds to AT&T after deducting  underwriter's discount and related fees
 and expenses of $10.3 billion.  AT&T attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds
 to the AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany  note receivable.  Net
 transfers to and from the AT&T Wireless Group and AT&T subsequent to the initial
 public offering are reflected as changes in the  intercompany  note  receivable.
 After the attributed $7.0 billion of initial public offering  proceeds are fully
 utilized,  AT&T  intends  to issue  short  term  floating  rate debt to the AT&T
 Wireless Group.
 
 On May 1, 2000,  following the initial public offering,  the AT&T Wireless Group
 recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to AT&T into
 an  additional  $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred  stock held by AT&T. In
 conjunction with the recapitalization,  the AT&T Wireless Group's long term debt
 due to AT&T was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a
 fixed rate of 8.1% per annum. AT&T has provided  financing at interest rates and
 on terms and conditions  that are consistent  with those the AT&T Wireless Group
 <PAGE>
 would receive as a  stand-alone  entity.  Sources for the AT&T Wireless  Group's
 future  financing  requirements  may include the  issuance  of  additional  AT&T
 Wireless Group tracking stock and the borrowing of funds.
 
 Financing  activities  for the AT&T  Wireless  Group  are  managed  by AT&T on a
 centralized  basis and are  subject  to the  review of the AT&T  Wireless  Group
 capital  stock  committee.  Loans from AT&T to any  member of the AT&T  Wireless
 Group will be made at interest rates and on other terms and conditions  designed
 to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rates  and  other  terms and
 conditions  that the AT&T  Wireless  Group  would be able to obtain  from  third
 parties,  including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate  of AT&T without the
 benefit of any guaranty by AT&T. This policy  contemplates that these loans will
 be made on the basis set forth above  regardless of the interest rates and other
 terms and  conditions  on which AT&T may have acquired the funds.  If,  however,
 AT&T incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available  funds for use by the
 AT&T  Wireless  Group,  those  fees or  charges  will be  allocated  to the AT&T
 Wireless Group.
 
 Net cash  provided by  operating  activities  for the six months  ended June 30,
 2000, was $223 million,  compared with $277 million for the same period in 1999.
 The  decrease in cash  provided by operating  activities  was  primarily  due to
 increases  in  inventories  and  accounts  receivable,  as well as a decrease in
 accounts  payable,  partially offset by increased income excluding  depreciation
 and amortization,  resulting from revenue growth and expense  leveraging for the
 first  half of 2000  compared  with the  first  half of 1999.  Net cash  used in
 investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2000, was $8,380 million,
 compared with $600 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999.  The increase
 was due primarily to the issuance of a note receivable  from AT&T,  acquisitions
 of the Bay Area Properties and Wireless One, and higher capital  expenditures to
 upgrade and increase  network  capacity in existing markets as well as to expand
 the national  footprint.  Net cash provided by financing  activities for the six
 months ended June 30, 2000, was $8,158  million,  compared with $411 million for
 the six months  June 30,  1999.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to  proceeds
 attributed  from the initial public offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking
 stock and increased  transfers from AT&T prior to the initial public offering to
 fund acquisitions and higher capital expenditures.
 
 EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  is the  primary  measure  used by the  chief
 operating  decision-makers to measure our ability to generate cash flow. EBITDA,
 excluding  other  income,  defined as  operating  income plus  depreciation  and
 amortization,  may or may not be consistent  with the  calculation of EBITDA for
 other public  companies and should not be viewed by investors as an  alternative
 to generally accepted accounting principles,  measures of performance or to cash
 flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
 liquidity.
 
 EBITDA,  excluding other income,  for the three and six month periods ended June
 30, 2000,  was $509 million and $904 million,  respectively,  compared with $324
 million and $513  million for the same  periods in 1999.  These  increases  were
 attributable  to  increases  in total  revenue and an  improving  margin as SG&A
 expenses  declined as a  percentage  of  revenues,  primarily  for our  mobility
 business.
 
 For our mobility business, EBITDA, excluding other income, for the three and six
 month  periods  ended  June  30,  2000,  was  $550  million  and  $981  million,
 respectively,  compared  with $347 million and $552 million for the same periods
 in 1999.
 
 For our fixed wireless business,  EBITDA,  excluding other income, for the three
 and six month periods ended June 30, 2000,  was a deficit of $40 million and $74
 million, respectively, compared with deficits of $17 million and $32 million for
 the same periods in 1999.
 <PAGE>
 EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  margins  were 20.5% and 19.3% for the second
 quarter and first half of 2000, respectively,  compared with 17.3% and 14.9% for
 the second  quarter and first half of, 1999,  respectively.  The  improvement in
 EBITDA,  excluding other income, margins in the second quarter and first half of
 2000  compared  with the  respective  periods  in 1999 was driven  primarily  by
 revenue growth and expense leveraging,  primarily  off-network roaming expenses,
 partially offset by increased  customer  acquisition and customer care costs, as
 well as  higher  information  technology  costs  associated  with  growth in the
 subscriber base.
 
 EBITDA, excluding other income, margins for our mobility business were 22.2% and
 21.0% for the second quarter and first half of 2000, respectively, compared with
 18.5% and 16.0% for the second quarter and first half of 1999, respectively. The
 improvement in EBITDA, excluding other income, margins in the second quarter and
 first  half of 2000  compared  with the  respective  periods  in 1999 was driven
 primarily by positive  EBITDA,  excluding  other income,  for the 1900 megahertz
 markets for the three and six month periods  ended June 30, 2000,  compared with
 losses  for the  respective  periods  in  1999,  as well  as  increased  EBITDA,
 excluding other income, margins in the 850 megahertz markets.
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
 Total  assets were $32,843  million as of June 30,  2000,  an increase of $9,331
 million,  or 39.7%,  compared  with  December  31,  1999.  The  increase was due
 primarily to the $7.0 billion of initial public offering proceeds  attributed to
 the  AT&T  Wireless  Group  from  AT&T  in  the  form  of an  intercompany  note
 receivable,   increases  in  goodwill,  licensing  costs,  property,  plant  and
 equipment,  and other assets  associated  with the  acquisitions of the Bay Area
 Properties  and Wireless One, and increased  property,  plant and equipment as a
 result of significant capital spending in the first half of 2000.  Additionally,
 non-consolidated investments increased as a result of the investment in American
 Cellular during 2000,  partially  offset by the acquisition of the remaining 50%
 interest in CMT Partners, which is now consolidated.
 
 Total  liabilities were $8,310 million as of June 30, 2000, a decrease of $1,185
 million,  or 12.5%,  compared with December 31, 1999. The decrease was primarily
 due to  the  decrease  in  long  term  debt  due  to  AT&T  resulting  from  the
 recapitalization  of the AT&T Wireless  Group  subsequent to the initial  public
 offering,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  deferred  income  taxes,  other
 long-term  liabilities,  and other current  liabilities.  Deferred incomes taxes
 increased due to the deferred tax provision  recognized for the six months ended
 June 30, 2000. Other long-term liabilities increased due to proceeds received in
 consideration for a long-term leasing arrangement, and other current liabilities
 increased due to increased business taxes and operating accruals.
 
 Total  preferred  stock held by AT&T increased to $3.0 billion at June 30, 2000,
 from $1.0  billion at December  31, 1999,  due to the  recapitalization  of $2.0
 billion of  intercompany  debt into  preferred  stock  subsequent to the initial
 public  offering.  Dividends  payable on the preferred stock were paid at 9% per
 annum.
 
 Total  equity was $24,522  million as of June 30,  2000,  an increase of $10,525
 million,  or 75.2%,  compared with December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily
 due to increased  combined  equity  associated  with the  attribution of initial
 public  offering  proceeds to the AT&T Wireless  Group, as well as net transfers
 from AT&T prior to the initial  public  offering to fund capital  expansion  and
 acquisitions, and the additional $2.0 billion of preferred stock issued to AT&T.
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
 In December  1999, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) issued Staff
 Accounting   Bulletin   (SAB)  No.  101,   "Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
 <PAGE>
 Statements".  SAB No. 101 provides  guidance on revenue  recognition,  including
 service  activation fees, and certain related costs,  which requires adoption by
 the end of fiscal year 2000. Management is currently assessing the impact of SAB
 No. 101 to the combined results of operations and financial position of the AT&T
 Wireless Group.
 
 In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
 of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative
 Instruments and Hedging  Activities".  Among other provisions,  it requires that
 entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
 <PAGE>
 statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
 Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
 would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
 qualifies for hedge accounting.  The effective date of this standard was delayed
 via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The effective date for SFAS No. 133 is now for
 fiscal  years  beginning  after  June  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
 encouraged and  retroactive  application  is  prohibited.  For the AT&T Wireless
 Group,  this means that the  standard  must be adopted no later than  January 1,
 2001.  Management  does not expect the  adoption  of this  standard  will have a
 material impact on the AT&T Wireless  Group's  results of operations,  financial
 position or cash flows.
 
 In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting for Certain  Derivative
 Instruments  and Certain  Hedging  Activities"  as an amendment to SFAS No. 133.
 This  statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
 issues  under SFAS No. 133 on specific  types of hedges.  It is not  expected to
 have a material  impact on the AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results  of  operations,
 financial position or cash flows.
 
 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
 On July 24, 2000, the AT&T Wireless  Group  announced it had signed a definitive
 agreement with SBC  Communications  to acquire its Indianapolis  wireless system
 for approximately $530 million in cash. The transaction has been approved by the
 boards of directors of AT&T and SBC Communications,  however, remains subject to
 certain  federal  regulatory  approvals  and is  expected to close by the end of
 2000.
