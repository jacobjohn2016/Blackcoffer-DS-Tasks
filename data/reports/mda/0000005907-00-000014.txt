 
 INTRODUCTION
 In 1999, we made  significant  strides to transform AT&T and deliver growth.  We
 finalized  many of the  strategic  acquisitions  we  announced  in 1998 and made
 additional investments to further support our facilities-based  growth strategy.
 We continued to maintain the execution-focused culture of the new AT&T.
 
 One of the most  dynamic  areas in 1999 was our  wireless  business.  Increasing
 demand for wireless  services and the  continued  appeal of our Digital One Rate
 (sm) plans drove Wireless  Services  revenue to grow  approximately  40% for the
 year.  Throughout  1999 we continued to expand our  national  footprint.  In the
 second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Vanguard Cellular Systems, which
 was announced in 1998; in August we closed the acquisition of Honolulu Cellular;
 and in October we announced the acquisition of American Cellular Corp. through a
 newly created joint venture  between AT&T and Dobson  Communications.  We capped
 off the year by  proposing  the  creation of a new class of tracking  stock that
 will reflect the economic  performance  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group.  While the
 Wireless  Group will  remain  part of AT&T,  the  separate  tracking  stock will
 provide current  shareowners and future  investors with a security tied directly
 to the performance of this business.
 
 As we worked to grow our wireless  businesses in 1999,  we also started  putting
 the bricks  and  mortar  around our  broadband  plans - a key  component  of our
 overall   growth   strategy.   We   completed   our  $52  billion   merger  with
 Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) in March, and quickly accelerated the upgrade of
 the TCI cable plant,  which will enable us to develop additional revenue streams
 from  any-distance  cable telephony,  high-speed data, and digital video. By the
 end of 1999,  TCI,  renamed AT&T  Broadband,  was offering cable telephony in 16
 cities   within   nine  pilot   markets,   digital-video   subscribers   totaled
 approximately  1.8 million,  and more than 200,000  customers  had signed up for
 high-speed  data  service.  To expand our  national  cable  network  beyond AT&T
 Broadband's  systems,  we announced in May the $57 billion merger with MediaOne.
 When the  merger  is  completed  in 2000,  we will  significantly  increase  our
 presence  in major  metropolitan  markets  across  the  country  with  owned and
 operated cable systems passing more than 26 million homes.
 
 In addition to the accomplishments in our domestic growth  initiatives,  we also
 made  significant  progress in our global  strategy.  Most notably,  we launched
 Concert - a leading global  telecommunications  company  created  through AT&T's
 joint venture with British  Telecommunications  plc (BT). Concert represents the
 core of our global strategy and began serving multinational  business customers,
 international  carriers and Internet service  providers in January 2000. As part
 of our  relationship  with  Concert  and BT,  we also  made  several  in-country
 facility-based  investments  during 1999,  including  AT&T Canada Corp.,  Rogers
 Cantel in Canada,  and Japan  Telecom.  We also  completed  the  purchase of IBM
 Global Network  Services and now provide data networking  services to businesses
 around the world as AT&T Global Network Services (AGNS).
 
 [Included in the 1999 Annual Report are pie charts entitled "Revenue
 Diversification by Product." These charts depict revenue by product for 1998 and
 1999.]
 
 In addition to delivering on our domestic and global  strategic  objectives  for
 1999, we also achieved the aggressive financial targets we set for the year. We
 
 <PAGE>
 
 delivered  revenue growth of 6.2% on a pro forma basis for the  acquisitions  of
 AT&T Broadband and AGNS, hitting our targeted range of 5% to 7%. The majority of
 the  increase  came from our  growth  businesses,  showing  the  success  of our
 investment  strategy  as it  begins  to shift  our  revenue  base away from long
 distance voice  revenue.  Just one year ago, long distance voice revenue was 75%
 of our  total  revenue;  in 1999 it  dropped  to 62%.  While  long  distance  is
 increasingly  becoming  a  commodity,  as  evidenced  by the  continued  pricing
 pressures in the industry,  its current  profitability  supports  investments in
 growth  businesses.  These  growth  businesses  in turn  will  support  the long
 distance  business as we include  long  distance  as a component  of a bundle of
 competitively priced services.
 
 In order to become truly  competitive,  we must become the low-cost  provider in
 the industry,  and  therefore,  we are continuing our efforts to reduce our cost
 structure.  A year ago, we committed to reducing our 1999  selling,  general and
 administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  to  23%  of  revenue.  We  beat  that  target,
 delivering  an SG&A  expense-to-revenue  ratio  of  21.7%  for the  year,  which
 translates into approximately $830 million of SG&A expense savings compared with
 our  targets.  The  fourth  quarter  came in at just  21.2%.  That's a  dramatic
 improvement from 1997, when the SG&A  expense-to-revenue  ratio for the year was
 27.9%.  While we've been  successful in driving  costs out of the  business,  we
 still have more to do. We will  continue to attack  costs and have  committed to
 cutting $2 billion in costs by the end of 2000 by continuing  to streamline  our
 SG&A expenses and by lowering our network  costs by moving more data,  voice and
 wireless traffic onto our expanding network of global facilities.
 
 Not surprisingly,  our success in growing revenue and shrinking costs allowed us
 to deliver strong cash flow results in 1999, with cash from  operations  growing
 to $11.6 billion - up 13.9% from 1998.  In 1999,  we generated  $18.3 billion of
 reported EBITDA [earnings,  including other income  (expense),  before interest,
 taxes, depreciation and amortization].
 
 As  anticipated,  the positive impact of our revenue growth and cost controls on
 earnings  per share was more than offset by the impact of shares  issued and the
 franchise, goodwill and other purchased intangibles amortization associated with
 our investments and acquisitions.  As a result,  earnings per diluted share were
 10.3% below 1998.  We  undertook an  aggressive  stock  buyback  program to help
 offset some of the dilutive impacts of these acquisitions,  and since the second
 half  of  1998  we've  repurchased  nearly  220  million  shares,  at a cost  of
 approximately  $10 billion.  In 2000, we plan to  repurchase  another 50 million
 shares from Cox Communications, Inc., in exchange for cable properties and cash.
 
 We've come a long way in 1999. As the following pages present in further detail,
 we've made solid progress in our strategy to transform AT&T, and we've delivered
 on our  commitments  for growth and expense  control.  There is still much to be
 done, but we finished 1999 with pride in our  accomplishments  and confidence in
 our ability to sustain the momentum and further accelerate our growth in 2000.
 
 OVERVIEW
 AT&T is among the world's  communications  leaders,  providing  voice,  data and
 video telecommunications  services to large and small businesses,  consumers and
 government  agencies.  We provide  domestic  and  international  long  distance,
 regional,  local and wireless  communications  services,  cable  television  and
 Internet  communication  services.  AT&T also  provides  billing,  directory and
 calling-card services to support our communications business.

 MERGER WITH TCI
 We completed the merger with TCI, renamed AT&T Broadband  (Broadband),  on March
 9, 1999, in an all-stock  transaction  valued at approximately  $52 billion.  We
 issued  approximately  664 million  shares,  of which 149 million were  treasury
 shares that were repurchased in anticipation of the Broadband merger.
 
 The  merger  was  recorded  under  the  purchase   method  of  accounting   and,
 accordingly,  the results of Broadband  have been  included  with the  financial
 results of AT&T since the date of acquisition.  Periods prior to the merger were
 not restated to include the results of Broadband.
 
 In connection with this transaction, we also issued a separate tracking stock to
 reflect the  economic  performance  of Liberty  Media Group  (LMG),  Broadband's
 former programming and technology investment businesses. We issued 1,140 million
 shares of Liberty  Media  Group  Class A tracking  stock  (including  60 million
 shares related to the conversion of convertible notes) and 110 million shares of
 Liberty  Media  Group  Class B  tracking  stock.  We do not  have a  controlling
 financial  interest in Liberty  Media Group for financial  accounting  purposes;
 therefore,  our  ownership in LMG is reflected as an  investment  accounted  for
 under the  equity  method in the AT&T  consolidated  financial  statements.  The
 amounts  attributable to LMG are reflected as separate line items "Equity losses
 from Liberty  Media Group" and  "Investment  in Liberty  Media Group and related
 receivables, net" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
 Broadband's cable and certain other operations, including its ownership interest
 in  At  Home   Corporation   (Excite@Home)   and   Cablevision   Systems   Corp.
 (Cablevision),  but excluding LMG, were combined with the existing operations of
 AT&T to form the AT&T Common Stock Group (AT&T Group), the economic  performance
 of which is represented by AT&T common stock. References to AT&T common stock do
 not include the LMG tracking stock.
 
 Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock or Liberty  Media Class A or B tracking
 stock does not represent a direct legal  interest in the assets and  liabilities
 of either of the groups, but an ownership of AT&T in total. Each of these shares
 represents an interest in the economic  performance of the net assets of each of
 these groups.  Accordingly,  the earnings and losses related to LMG are excluded
 from earnings  available to AT&T Group,  and earnings and losses related to AT&T
 Group are excluded from earnings available to LMG.
 
 Because we account for LMG as an equity investment, revenue, operating expenses,
 other income (expense),  interest expense and provision for taxes for AT&T Group
 are the same as consolidated AT&T.
 
 The  discussion  and  analysis  that  follows  provides  information  management
 believes is relevant to an assessment and  understanding of AT&T's  consolidated
 results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997, and
 financial condition as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.

 Our results include certain items that affect  comparability  from year to year.
 We  quantify  the  impact of these  items in order to explain  our  results on a
 comparable  basis.  These items include the 1999  acquisitions  of Broadband and
 AT&T Global  Network  Services  (AGNS),  net  restructuring  and other  charges,
 significant  gains on sales of businesses  [discussed in other income  (expense)
 discussion] and the impact of a change in tax rules. The net  restructuring  and
 other charges, gains on sales of businesses,  change in tax rules and the impact
 of our investments in Excite@Home and Cablevision are  collectively  referred to
 as "restructuring  and other charges,  and certain gains and losses." We discuss
 our  results  excluding  the  impact  of  our  investments  in  Excite@Home  and
 Cablevision since these businesses have financial information publicly available
 and their results can be reviewed independently of AT&T's results.
 
 <PAGE>
 
 Following is a summary of the approximate diluted earnings per share (EPS)
 impact of the above items for 1999 and 1998:
  ..Net restructuring and other charges of $0.37 in 1999 and $0.59 in 1998;
  ..Gains on sales of businesses of $0.07 in 1999 and $0.18 in 1998;
  ..A loss of $0.18 reflecting the earnings impact of our investments in
       Excite@Home and Cablevision in 1999; and
  ..A $0.02 benefit in 1999 from changes in tax rules with respect to the
       utilization of acquired net operating losses.
 
 Operating  income,  on a reported  basis,  increased 45.0% in 1999 compared with
 1998; excluding net restructuring and other charges,  operating income increased
 23.6%.  Operating income margin  (operating  income as a percent of revenue) was
 17.4% in 1999 compared with 14.1% in 1998.  Operating  income margin,  excluding
 net  restructuring  and other charges,  was 19.8% in 1999 compared with 18.8% in
 1998. These  operational  improvements  were due to revenue growth and operating
 expense efficiencies.
 
 EPS from  continuing  operations  attributable  to AT&T Group on a diluted basis
 declined  10.3% in 1999 to $1.74,  compared with 1998. The decline was primarily
 due to the impact of the Broadband and AGNS  acquisitions,  including the impact
 of shares issued and equity losses of  Excite@Home  and  Cablevision.  Partially
 offsetting these declines was increased income from the remaining operations due
 to  revenue  growth  and  operating  expense  efficiencies  as well as lower net
 restructuring and other charges.  Excluding the restructuring and other charges,
 and  certain  gains  and  losses,  EPS was $2.20 per  diluted  share in 1999,  a
 decrease of 6.4%,  or $0.15,  over the prior year.  The decrease in  operational
 earnings  in 1999  was  primarily  due to the  impacts  of the  acquisitions  of
 Broadband and AGNS.
 
 Excluding the impacts of both Broadband and AGNS,  operational  EPS for 1999 was
 $3.08,  an increase of 31.1%,  or $0.73,  compared  with 1998.  The increase was
 primarily due to higher revenue combined with improving  margins  resulting from
 cost efficiencies.
 
 Operating  income,  on a reported  basis,  increased  9.5% in 1998 compared with
 1997;  excluding net  restructuring,  exit and other charges,  in 1998 and 1997,
 operating income increased 42.2%.
 
 Results for 1997 include net restructuring and other charges,  and a gain from a
 sale of a  business,  which  resulted in an  approximate  $0.01 EPS benefit on a
 diluted basis. In addition,  1998 included a benefit from the 1998 adoption of a
 new accounting standard related to the capitalization of internal-use  software.
 EPS from continuing  operations was $1.94 per diluted share in 1998, an increase
 of 22.0% from 1997.  Excluding the impact of the 1998 and 1997 restructuring and
 other charges,  and certain gains and losses, EPS was $2.30 per diluted share in
 1998,  an  increase  of $0.72,  or  45.6%,  compared  with  1997.  Cost  control
 initiatives  and higher  revenue  were the  primary  drivers of the  operational
 increases.

 Total revenue                              $62,391   $53,223   $51,577
 
 Total revenue  increased  17.2%,  or $9,168  million,  in 1999 compared with the
 prior year.  Revenue for 1999  included  Broadband  and AGNS  revenue from their
 respective  dates of  acquisition.  Excluding the impact of these  acquisitions,
 1999 revenue  increased  5.8% to $56,307  million.  This  increase was fueled by
 growth in wireless,  business  data,  business  domestic long distance voice and
 outsourcing revenue,  partially offset by the continued decline of consumer long
 distance  voice  revenue.  Adjusting  1999 and 1998 to  reflect  the  revenue of
 Broadband  and AGNS for a full  year in both  periods,  1999 pro  forma  revenue
 increased 6.2% to $64,141 million from $60,394 million in 1998.
 
 Long  distance  voice  revenue  as  a  percent  of  total  revenue  declined  to
 approximately 62% in 1999,  compared with  approximately 75% and 79% in 1998 and
 1997,  respectively.  We expect this  percentage to continue to decline as data,
 Internet, wireless and outsourcing revenue continue to grow and as long distance
 prices continue to decrease, resulting in a more diversified portfolio.
 
 Total revenue in 1998 increased $1,646 million, or 3.2%, compared with 1997, led
 by business data, wireless and outsourcing revenue.  Improvements in these areas
 were partially offset by a decline in consumer long distance revenue and reduced
 revenue due to the sale of AT&T Solutions Customer Care (ASCC) in 1998.
 
 Revenue by segment is discussed in more detail in the segment results section.
 
 OPERATING EXPENSES
 For the year,  operating expenses totaled $51,532 million,  an increase of 12.7%
 from $45,736 million in 1998. In 1998,  operating  expenses  increased 2.2% from
 $44,741 million in 1997.  Operating expenses for 1999 reflect Broadband and AGNS
 expenses from their  respective  dates of  acquisition.  In addition,  operating
 expenses  in  1999  and  1998  included   $1,506  million  and  $2,514  million,
 respectively, of net restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses in 1997
 included a $160 million charge to exit the two-way messaging business and a $100
 million benefit from the reversal of pre-1995 restructuring reserves.  Excluding
 the impact of the  acquisitions of Broadband and AGNS and net  restucturing  and
 other charges, 1999 operating expenses increased $198 million, or 0.5%, and 1998
 operating expenses decreased 2.8%.

 For the Years Ended December 31,        1999      1998      1997
 Dollars in millions
 Access and other interconnection     $14,686   $15,328   $16,350
 
 Access  and other  interconnection  expenses  are the  charges we pay to connect
 calls on the  facilities of local exchange  carriers and other domestic  service
 providers, and fees we pay foreign telephone companies (international
 
 <PAGE>
 
 settlements) to connect calls made to foreign countries. These charges represent
 payments to these  carriers for shared and  dedicated  facilities  and switching
 equipment used to connect our network with their networks.  These costs declined
 $642  million,  or 4.2%, in 1999 and $1,022  million,  or 6.3%, in 1998 compared
 with the prior year. These declines were primarily driven by mandated reductions
 in per-minute access rates in 1999 and 1998 and lower  international  settlement
 rates resulting from our negotiations with international carriers. Additionally,
 we continue to manage these costs through more efficient  network  usage.  These
 reductions were partially  offset by volume growth,  increased  per-line charges
 (Primary   Interexchange   Carrier   Charges)   and   Universal   Service   Fund
 contributions.  Since most of these charges are passed  through to the customer,
 the per-minute  access-rate reductions and the increases in per-line charges and
 the Universal  Service Fund have generally  resulted in an offsetting  impact on
 revenue.  Broadband  and AGNS do not have any access  and other  interconnection
 expenses, therefore the results are the same excluding Broadband and AGNS.
 
 For the Years Ended December 31,          1999      1998      1997
 Dollars in millions
 Network and other costs of services    $14,385   $10,495   $10,038
 
 Network and other costs of services  expenses include the costs of operating and
 maintaining our networks, costs to support our outsourcing contracts,  fees paid
 to other wireless carriers for the use of their networks (off-network  roaming),
 the provision for uncollectible receivables, programming and licensing costs for
 cable services, costs of wireless handsets sold and other service-related costs.
 These costs  increased  $3,890  million,  or 37.1%,  in 1999 compared with 1998,
 largely  due  to  the  Broadband   and  AGNS   acquisitions.   Excluding   these
 acquisitions,  network costs increased $428 million,  or 4.1%, in 1999, a slight
 improvement  compared  with the 4.5%  increase  in 1998.  The  growing  wireless
 subscriber base primarily drove the increase in both years, largely attributable
 to the success of AT&T  Digital One Rate  service,  which has resulted in higher
 off-network  roaming charges,  costs of handsets and provision for uncollectible
 receivables.  The  increase  in costs of handsets  reflects  not only the higher
 number of handsets sold, but the increased cost per unit as customers migrate or
 sign up for digital  service.  Costs to support growth in outsourcing  contracts
 also  contributed to the increase.  Partially  offsetting the 1999 increase were
 network cost-control  initiatives,  lower per-call compensation expense due to a
 favorable FCC ruling in 1999, lower provision for  uncollectible  receivables in
 Consumer and Business  Services and lower gross receipts and property taxes. The
 1998  increase  was  partially  offset  by  lower  provision  for  uncollectible
 receivables in Business Services, lower expenses as a result of the sale of ASCC
 in the first quarter of 1998 and the impact of a 1997 charge to  write-down  the
 two-way messaging business.

 Dollars in millions
 Selling, general and administrative     $13,516    $12,770   $14,371
 
 Selling,  general and administrative  (SG&A) expenses increased $746 million, or
 5.8%,  in 1999  compared  with 1998.  This increase was due to the Broadband and
 AGNS  acquisitions.  Excluding  these  expenses,  SG&A  expenses  declined  $529
 million,  or 4.2%.  Reductions  in consumer  long  distance  acquisition-program
 spending  resulted in lower marketing and sales  expenses.  In 1999 we continued
 our  efforts  to  achieve  a  best-in-class   cost  structure  with  companywide
 cost-control  initiatives,  which  yielded an improving  cost  structure.  These
 decreases were partially offset by increased costs in Wireless Services to
 
 <PAGE>
 
 support the growing  subscriber base. SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue were
 21.7% in 1999,  24.0% in 1998 and 27.9% in 1997.  We expect  SG&A  expenses as a
 percent of revenue to continue to decline as we continue to focus on controlling
 our expenses and prioritizing our spending.  In addition, we expect to realize a
 larger  pension  credit in 2000 resulting from a higher pension trust asset base
 and  an  increase  in  the  discount  rate  used  to  measure  the  pension  and
 postretirement obligations.
 
 [Included  in the 1999 Annual  Report is a bar graph  entitled  "Cost  Structure
 Improvements - SG&A Expenses as a Percent of Revenue" showing SG&A expenses as a
 percent of revenue for the eight quarters ended December 31, 1999.]
 
 SG&A expenses declined $1,601 million, or 11.1%, in 1998 compared with 1997. The
 decrease was primarily  due to savings from  cost-control  initiatives,  such as
 headcount  reductions  and a $221  million  SG&A  expense  benefit from the 1998
 adoption of a new  accounting  pronouncement  related to the  capitalization  of
 internal-use  software  (Statement of Position 98-1).  Also  contributing to the
 decrease in SG&A expenses was a decline in marketing and sales costs relating to
 lower  customer  acquisition  costs in Consumer  Services.  These  declines were
 partially  offset by increases in wireless  customer  acquisition  and migration
 costs and increased  costs  associated  with preparing our computer  systems for
 conversion of the calendar to the Year 2000 (Y2K project).
 
 Also included in SG&A expenses were $550 million,  $513 million and $633 million
 of research and development (R&D) expenses in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
 R&D  expenditures  are mainly for work on advanced  communications  services and
 projects aimed at Internet protocol (IP) services.  The increase in R&D expenses
 in 1999 was due to costs associated with launching  Concert,  the acquisition of
 Broadband  and  development  spending on business  data  services  and IP. These
 increases were largely offset by lower R&D spending on development  projects for
 consumer  products.  The  decline in R&D  expenses in 1998 was mainly due to the
 redeployment of resources in support of the Y2K project.

 Depreciation and other amortization    $6,138     $4,378    $3,728
 
 Depreciation and other amortization expenses increased $1,760 million, or 40.2%,
 in 1999.  Approximately  one-half of the increase was due to the acquisitions of
 Broadband  and  AGNS.  Excluding  these  acquisitions,  depreciation  and  other
 amortization  expenses increased $879 million,  or 20.1%, in 1999.  Depreciation
 and other  amortization  expenses  increased  $650  million,  or 17.4%,  in 1998
 compared  with  1997.  Growth  in the  depreciable  asset  base  resulting  from
 continued  infrastructure  investment  drove the  increase in both years.  Total
 capital  expenditures  for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $13.5 billion,  $8.0 billion
 and $7.7 billion,  respectively.  Approximately  three-quarters  of 1999 capital
 expenditures  focused on our growth  businesses  of broadband,  data,  wireless,
 local and AT&T  Solutions.  More than half of the capital  expenditures  in 1998
 were related to the long distance network, including the completion of the SONET
 (Synchronous  Optical Network)  buildout.  These  expenditures  expanded network
 capacity,  reliability and efficiency.  In addition,  in 1998 we invested in our
 local network to expand our  switching  and  transport  capacity and invested to
 expand our wireless footprint.

 <PAGE>
 
 Amortization  of  goodwill,  franchise  costs  and other  purchased  intangibles
 increased  $1,050  million  in 1999  compared  with  1998  primarily  due to the
 acquisition  of  Broadband  and,  to a  lesser  extent,  AGNS.  Franchise  costs
 represent the value  attributable to the agreement with local  authorities  that
 allow access to homes in Broadband's service areas. Other purchased  intangibles
 arising  from  business  combinations  primarily  included  customer  lists  and
 licenses.  In addition to the  amortization of goodwill  reflected here, we also
 have amortization of goodwill  associated with our  nonconsolidated  investments
 recorded as a component of other income  (expense).  This  amortization  totaled
 $495 million, $52 million and $66 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
 
 Net Restructuring and Other Charges
 
 During 1999, we recorded $1,506 million of net  restructuring and other charges,
 which had an approximate $0.37 impact on earnings per diluted share.
 
 A  $594  million  in-process   research  and  development  charge  was  recorded
 reflecting  the  estimated  fair value of research and  development  projects at
 Broadband,  as of the  date  of the  acquisition,  which  had  not  yet  reached
 technological  feasibility or that have no alternative  future use. The projects
 identified   related   to   Broadband's   efforts   to  offer   voice  over  IP,
 product-integration  efforts for advanced set-top devices,  cost-savings efforts
 for cable  telephony  implementation  and  in-process  research and  development
 related to Excite@Home.  We estimated the fair value of in-process  research and
 development  for each project  using an income  approach,  which was adjusted to
 allocate fair value based on the project's percentage of completion.  Under this
 approach,  the present value of the anticipated  future benefits of the projects
 was determined using a discount rate of 17%. For each project, the resulting net
 present  value was  multiplied  by a percentage  of  completion  based on effort
 expended to date versus projected costs to complete.
 
 The  charge  associated  with  voice  over IP  technology,  which  allows  voice
 telephony  traffic to be digitized and transmitted in IP data packets,  was $225
 million as of the date of the acquisition.  Current voice over IP equipment does
 not yet  support  many of the  features  required to connect  customer  premises
 equipment to traditional phone networks.  Further technical  development is also
 needed  to  ensure   voice   quality   that  is   comparable   to   conventional
 circuit-switched  telephony  and  to  reduce  the  power  consumption  of the IP
 telephony equipment.  We anticipate that we will test IP telephony equipment for
 field deployment in late 2000.
 
 The charge associated with Broadband's  product-integration efforts for advanced
 set-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,
 was  $114  million  as of the date of  acquisition.  The  associated  technology
 consists of the development  and  integration  work needed to provide a suite of
 software  tools to run on the  digital  set-top  box  hardware  platform.  It is
 anticipated that field trials will begin in mid 2000 for next-generation digital
 services.
 
 The charge associated with Broadband's  cost-savings efforts for cable telephony
 implementation  was $101  million as of the date of the  acquisition.  Telephony
 cost  reductions  primarily  consist of cost savings from the  development  of a
 "line of power switch," which allows Broadband to cost effectively provide power
 for customer telephony equipment through the cable plant. This device will allow
 us to provide  line-powered  telephony  without  burying  the cable line to each
 house.  The device currently  requires further  development in order to reach an
 acceptable level of reliability. We expect to test and deploy devices by the end
 of 2000.
 
 <PAGE>
 
 Additionally,   the  in-process  research  and  development  charge  related  to
 Excite@Home  was valued at $154 million.  During the second  quarter of 1999, we
 ceased to consolidate  Excite@Home and began to account for our investment under
 the equity method of accounting  due to certain  corporate  governance  changes,
 which  resulted  in AT&T no longer  holding a  controlling  financial  interest.
 Accordingly, we will no longer report on the in-process research and development
 projects of Excite@Home.
 
 Although  there are  significant  technological  issues to  overcome in order to
 successfully  complete the acquired  in-process  research  and  development,  we
 expect successful  completion.  We estimate the costs to complete the identified
 projects  will not have a  material  impact on our  results of  operations.  If,
 however,  we are  unable to  establish  technological  feasibility  and  produce
 commercially viable products/services,  then anticipated incremental future cash
 flows attributable to expected profits from such new  products/services  may not
 be realized.
 
 A $531 million asset  impairment  charge was primarily  recorded in  association
 with the planned disposal of wireless network equipment resulting from a program
 to increase capacity and operating  efficiency of our wireless network.  As part
 of a multivendor  program,  contracts are being executed with certain vendors to
 replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure  equipment in the
 western United States and the  metropolitan  New York markets.  The program will
 provide Wireless Services with the newest  technology  available and allow us to
 evolve  to  new,  third-generation  digital  technology,  with  high-speed  data
 capabilities.
 
 The planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure  equipment required
 an evaluation of asset  impairment  in  accordance  with  Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
 Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of" to write-down  these assets
 to their fair value, which was estimated by discounting the expected future cash
 flows of these assets through the date of disposal. Since the assets will remain
 in service  from the date of the  decision  to  dispose  of these  assets to the
 disposal  date,  the remaining net book value of the assets will be  depreciated
 over this period.
 
 A $145 million charge for  restructuring  and exit costs was recorded as part of
 AT&T's  initiative  to  reduce  costs  by $2  billion  by the end of  2000.  The
 restructuring  and exit plans primarily  focus on the  maximization of synergies
 through  headcount  reductions  in Business  Services  and  network  operations,
 including the consolidation of customer-care and call centers.
 
 Included  in the  exit  costs  was $142  million  of cash  termination  benefits
 associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of
 voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  Approximately  one-half of the
 separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
 Approximately 1,700 employee separations related to involuntary terminations and
 approximately  1,100  related  to  voluntary  terminations.  Nearly  80%  of the
 affected  employees  have left their  positions as of December 31, 1999, and the
 remaining employees will leave the company in early 2000.  Termination  benefits
 of $40  million  were paid in the fourth  quarter of 1999.  This cash outlay was
 primarily  funded  through  cash  from  operations.  The  balance  of  the  cash
 termination payments are expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2000.
 
 The restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of approximately
 $250 million per year, as well as EBIT [earnings, including other
 
 <PAGE>
 
 income  (expense),  before  interest and taxes]  savings of  approximately  $200
 million in 2000 and nearly $400 million per year thereafter. We expect increased
 spending in growth  businesses  will largely offset these cash and EBIT savings.
 The EBIT savings, primarily attributable to reduced personnel-related  expenses,
 will be realized in SG&A expenses and network and other costs of services.  EBIT
 savings in 2000 are expected to be partially offset by accelerated  depreciation
 expense. However, depreciation expense in subsequent years will be lower related
 to the 1999 write-off of Wireless Services' assets.
 
 In addition,  our continuing efforts to reduce costs by $2 billion by the end of
 2000 and the planned merger with MediaOne may require  further  charges for exit
 and  separation  plans,  which we expect to have  finalized in the first half of
 2000.
 
 We also recorded net losses of $307 million  related to the  government-mandated
 disposition  of  certain  international  businesses  that  would  have  competed
 directly  with  Concert,  and $50 million  related to a  contribution  agreement
 Broadband  entered  into with  Phoenixstar,  Inc.,  that  requires  Broadband to
 satisfy  certain  liabilities  owed by  Phoenixstar  and its  subsidiaries.  The
 remaining  obligation  under this  contribution  agreement  is $26  million.  In
 addition,  we recorded  benefits of $121 million  related to the  settlement  of
 pension  obligations  for former  employees who accepted  AT&T's 1998  voluntary
 retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer.
 
 During 1998, we recorded $2,514 million of net  restructuring and other charges,
 which had an approximate $0.59 impact on earnings per diluted share. The bulk of
 the charge was  associated  with a plan to reduce  headcount by 15,000 to 18,000
 over two years as part of our overall cost-reduction program. In connection with
 this plan, the VRIP was offered to eligible management employees.  Approximately
 15,300 management  employees accepted the VRIP offer. A restructuring  charge of
 $2,724  million was composed of $2,254  million and $169 million for pension and
 postretirement  special-termination  benefits,  respectively,  $263  million  of
 curtailment  losses  and $38  million  of other  administrative  costs.  We also
 recorded charges of $125 million for related facility costs and $150 million for
 executive-separation  costs.  These charges were partially offset by benefits of
 $940 million as we settled pension  benefit  obligations for 13,700 of the total
 VRIP  employees.  In addition,  the VRIP charges  were  partially  offset by the
 reversal  of $256  million of 1995  business  restructuring  reserves  primarily
 resulting from the overlap of VRIP on certain 1995 projects.
 
 Also  included  in the 1998 net  restructuring  and  other  charges  were  asset
 impairment  charges totaling $718 million,  of which $633 million was related to
 our  decision  not to  pursue  Total  Service  Resale  (TSR) as a local  service
 strategy. We also recorded an $85 million asset impairment charge related to the
 write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain international  operations in which
 the carrying value is no longer supported by future cash flows.  This charge was
 made in  connection  with the  review of  certain  operations  that  would  have
 competed directly with Concert.
 
 Additionally,  $85 million of  merger-related  expenses were recorded in 1998 in
 connection with the Teleport  Communications  Group Inc. (TCG) merger, which was
 accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Partially  offsetting these charges in
 1998 was a $92 million reversal of the 1995 restructuring reserve. This reversal
 reflects reserves that were no longer deemed necessary.  The reversal  primarily
 included  separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower than
 originally   anticipated.   Consistent  with  the  three-year   plan,  the  1995
 restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 1998.

 Other income (expense)                     $(501)   $1,247      $443
 
 Other  income  (expense)  was an expense of $501 million in 1999  compared  with
 income of $1,247 million in 1998. The significant  decrease is due to higher net
 losses from investments,  largely due to Excite@Home and Cablevision,  and lower
 gains on sales.  Gains on sales in 1999 included $153 million from Language Line
 Services,  $88 million  from WOOD-TV and $110 million from the sale of a portion
 of our ownership  interest in AT&T Canada.  Gains on sales in 1998 included $350
 million from AT&T  Solutions  Customer  Care,  $317 million from LIN  Television
 Corp.  (LIN-TV)  and $103  million  from  SmarTone  Telecommunications  Holdings
 Limited  (SmarTone).  Distributions  on trust  preferred  securities in 1999 and
 higher  interest  income in 1998 as a result of the proceeds  received  from the
 sale of Universal Card Services (UCS) also contributed to the decrease.
 
 Other income (expense)  increased $804 million in 1998 due primarily to gains on
 sales in 1998 as well as increased  interest  income on our higher cash balance.
 These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from equity  investments
 and a gain in 1997 on the sale of AT&T Skynet Satellite Services (Skynet) of $97
 million.

 EBIT  increased  $1,624  million,  or  18.6%,  in  1999.  EBIT was  impacted  by
 restructuring  and other charges,  and certain gains and losses,  as well as the
 acquisitions of Broadband and AGNS. Excluding these items, EBIT increased $2,805
 million,  or 26.8%,  to $13,283 million in 1999. The improvement in EBIT was due
 to increased  revenue  combined with an improving cost structure.  EBIT for 1998
 increased $1,455 million, or 20.0%.  Excluding  restructuring and other charges,
 and certain gains and losses,  EBIT increased  $3,037  million,  or 41.9%.  This
 increase in EBIT was driven by higher  revenue,  the benefit of our SG&A expense
 cost-cutting initiatives and lower international settlement rates.

 Interest  expense  increased $1,224 million in 1999 due to a higher average debt
 balance  associated  with  our  acquisitions,  including  debt  outstanding  for
 Broadband at the date of acquisition. Interest expense increased $120 million in
 1998. After the sale of UCS on April 2, 1998,  interest expense  associated with
 debt previously attributed to UCS was reclassified from discontinued  operations
 to  continuing  operations  since  we did  not  retire  all of this  debt.  This
 reclassification is the primary reason for the increase in 1998.

 Provision for income taxes             $3,257       $3,072      $2,723
 
 The effective  income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a percent of
 income from continuing  operations before income taxes. The effective income tax
 rate was 48.7% in 1999,  37.0% in 1998 and 39.0% in 1997.  The effective  income
 tax rate for AT&T Group was 37.4% in 1999,  37.0% in 1998 and 39.0% in 1997. The
 1999 effective tax rate for AT&T Group was impacted by the in-process research
 
 <PAGE>
 
 and development  charge,  which was not tax deductible,  and a change in the net
 operating loss utilization tax rules that resulted in a $75 million reduction in
 the valuation  allowance  and the income tax  provision.  In addition,  the 1999
 effective   tax  rate   reflects  tax  benefits   associated   with   investment
 dispositions, legal entity restructurings and other tax planning strategies. The
 effective  tax rate for 1998 was  impacted  by the  pooling of TCG's  historical
 results,  which did not include tax benefits on preacquisition  losses,  and the
 effects  of  certain   foreign  legal  entity   restructurings   and  investment
 dispositions.
 
 Discontinued  Operations Pursuant to Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 30
 "Reporting  the Results of  Operations - Reporting  the Effects of Disposal of a
 Segment of a Business,  and  Extraordinary,  Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring
 Events and Transactions," the consolidated  financial statements of AT&T reflect
 the  dispositions of UCS, which was sold on April 2, 1998, and AT&T's  submarine
 systems  business  (SSI),  which  was  sold  on July 1,  1997,  as  discontinued
 operations.  Accordingly,  the revenue,  costs and  expenses,  and cash flows of
 these  businesses  have  been  excluded  from  the  respective  captions  in the
 Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and
 have been reported through their respective dates of disposition as "Income from
 discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable  income  taxes;  and as "Net cash
 provided by (used in)  discontinued  operations."  As of December 31, 1998,  all
 businesses previously reported as discontinued operations have been disposed of;
 therefore,  there was no impact to the  Consolidated  Balance Sheets  presented.
 Gains   associated  with  these  sales  are  recorded  as  "Gains  on  sales  of
 discontinued operations," net of applicable taxes.
 
 Extraordinary Items
 In August 1998, AT&T extinguished $1,046 million of TCG's debt. The $217 million
 pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt was recorded as an extraordinary
 loss. The after-tax impact was $137 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

 SEGMENT RESULTS
 
 In support of the  services we provide,  we segment our results by the  business
 units that support our primary lines of business:  Business  Services,  Consumer
 Services,   Wireless  Services  and  Broadband.  A  fifth  category,  Other  and
 Corporate,  comprises  the results of all other  units of AT&T Group,  including
 corporate  staff  functions.   We  supplementally  discuss  AT&T  Solutions  and
 International  Operations and Ventures, which are both included in the Other and
 Corporate category. Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG.
 
 The discussion of segment results includes  revenue;  earnings,  including other
 income (expense),  before interest and taxes (EBIT);  earnings,  including other
 income  (expense),   before  interest,   taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization
 (EBITDA);  total assets;  and capital  additions.  The  discussion of EBITDA for
 Wireless  Services and Broadband is modified to exclude other income  (expense).
 Total  assets  for  each  segment  include  all  assets,   except   intercompany
 receivables.  Prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate
 are  generally  held at the  corporate  level and  therefore are included in the
 Other and Corporate group. Shared network assets are allocated to the segments
 
 <PAGE>
 
 and reallocated each January,  based on two years of volumes.  Capital additions
 for each segment include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,
 acquisitions of licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in
 franchise costs and additions to internal-use software.
 
 EBIT is the primary  measure used by AT&T's chief  operating  decision makers to
 measure  AT&T's  operating  results  and to measure  segment  profitability  and
 performance.  AT&T  calculates  EBIT  as  operating  income  plus  other  income
 (expense).  In  addition,  management  also uses  EBITDA as a measure of segment
 profitability  and  performance,  and is defined as EBIT plus  depreciation  and
 amortization. Interest and taxes are not factored into the profitability measure
 used by the chief operating decision makers;  therefore,  trends for these items
 are discussed on a consolidated basis. Management believes EBIT is meaningful to
 investors  because it provides  analysis  of  operating  results  using the same
 measures used by AT&T's chief operating decision makers and provides a return on
 total capitalization  measure. We believe EBITDA is meaningful to investors as a
 measure of each segment's liquidity  consistent with the measure utilized by our
 chief  operating  decision  makers.  In addition,  we believe that both EBIT and
 EBITDA allow investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each segment
 in  relation  to AT&T.  Our  calculation  of EBIT and  EBITDA  may or may not be
 consistent  with the  calculation of these  measures by other public  companies.
 EBIT and EBITDA should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally
 accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  measures  of income  as a  measure  of
 performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities
 as a measure  of  liquidity.  In  addition,  EBITDA  does not take into  account
 changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flow.
 
 Reflecting the dynamics of our business,  we  continually  review our management
 model and structure.  In 2000, we anticipate changes to our segments as follows:
 The  Business  Services  segment will be expanded to include the results of AT&T
 Solutions,  and Broadband  results will be expanded to include the operations of
 MediaOne upon the completion of the merger.  The Wireless  Services segment will
 be expanded  to include  fixed  wireless  technology  and certain  international
 wireless investments.
 
 BUSINESS SERVICES
 Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications services
 including  long  distance,  local  and  data  and IP  networking  to  small  and
 medium-sized  businesses,   large  domestic  and  multinational  businesses  and
 government agencies.  Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IP
 transport to service resellers (wholesale services).

 REVENUE
 In 1999,  Business Services revenue grew $1,491 million, or 6.3%, driven by data
 and IP services, domestic long distance voice services and local services. Total
 calling  volumes  increased  approximately  25% for the  year.  Revenue  in 1998
 increased $1,280 million, or 5.7%, led by growth in data services.
 
 Data services,  which is the  transportation of data rather than voice along our
 network,  grew at a  high-teens  rate in 1999 and at a mid-teens  rate for 1998.
 Growth in each  period  was led by the  continued  strength  of frame  relay and
 high-speed  private  line,  both  of  which  are  high-speed   data-transmission
 services.  On average in 1999, we added  approximately  230 more net frame ports
 per month as compared with 1998. Also  contributing  to the revenue  increase in
 1999 was significant  growth in IP services,  such as AT&T WorldNet Services and

 Long  distance  voice revenue grew at a low  single-digit  rate in both 1999 and
 1998.  The continued  strength of volumes,  as evidenced by a high-teens  growth
 rate for 1999 and a near-teens  growth rate for 1998, was largely mitigated by a
 declining  average  price per minute.  The average price per minute has declined
 due to  competitive  forces  within the industry  that are expected to continue.
 Also  impacting the average price per minute was a change in product mix,  which
 in 1999 was largely attributable to an increase in our wholesale business sales,
 which  had a lower  rate  per  minute.  Revenue  in 1998 was  also  impacted  by
 reductions in access costs that were passed on to customers in the form of lower
 rates.
 
 Local voice service revenue grew more than 50% in 1999.  During 1999, AT&T added
 more than 626,000  access lines,  with the total reaching 1.3 million by the end
 of the year.  Access lines enable AT&T to provide  local service to customers by
 allowing  direct  connection from customer  equipment to the AT&T network.  AT&T
 serves more than 36,000 buildings in 89 metropolitan  statistical  areas (MSAs),
 with just over 5,800 of the buildings on-network  (buildings where AT&T owns the
 fiber that runs into the building).  At the end of 1998, we served approximately
 20,000 buildings in 83 MSAs, with about 5,200 buildings on-network.

 Business Services  internal revenue  increased $657 million,  or 72.5%, in 1999.
 The increase is the result of greater sales of business  long distance  services
 to other AT&T units, primarily AT&T Solutions (including the impact of AGNS) and
 Wireless Services, which resell such services to their external customers.
 
 EBIT/EBITDA
 EBIT rose $1,124 million, or 22.5%, and EBITDA grew $1,684 million, or 22.8%, in
 1999.  Excluding 1999  restructuring  and exit costs,  EBIT  increased  24.4% to
 $6,226 million and EBITDA  increased  24.1% to $9,174  million.  These increases
 were driven by revenue growth  combined with margin  improvement  resulting from
 ongoing  cost-control  initiatives.  The increase in EBIT was offset somewhat by
 increased  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  resulting  from  increased
 capital expenditures aimed at data, IP and local services.
 
 EBIT increased $960 million,  or 23.7%, and EBITDA increased $1,493 million,  or
 25.3%,  in 1998. The increases were driven by growth in revenue and the benefits
 reaped from cost-cutting initiatives. Partly offsetting the increase in EBIT and
 EBITDA in 1998 was the gain on the sale of Skynet, recorded in 1997. In

 addition,  the EBIT improvements were partially offset by increased depreciation
 and  amortization  expenses  correlated to the continued  high levels of capital
 expenditures.
