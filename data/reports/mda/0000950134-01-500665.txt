         OF OPERATIONS
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000
 
 SUMMARY AMR's loss from continuing operations during the first quarter of 2001
 was $43 million, or $0.28 loss per share, as compared to income from continuing
 operations of $89 million, or $0.57 per share diluted, for the same period in
 2000. AMR's operating income of $17 million decreased $195 million compared to
 the same period in 2000.
 
 The Company's REVENUES increased $183 million, or 4.0 percent, in the first
 quarter of 2001 versus the same period last year. American's PASSENGER REVENUES
 increased by 4.3 percent, or $161 million. American's YIELD (the average amount
 one passenger pays to fly one mile) of 14.88 cents increased by 6.7 percent
 compared to the same period in 2000. Domestic yields increased 6.6 percent from
 the first quarter of 2000. International yields increased 6.8 percent, primarily
 due to an increase of 7.9 percent and 7.1 percent in European and Latin American
 yields, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 1.0
 percent in Pacific yields. Yields were up year-over-year largely due to fare
 increases enacted over the course of 2000.
 
 American's traffic or REVENUE PASSENGER MILES (RPMs) decreased 2.1 percent to
 26.5 billion miles for the quarter ended March 31, 2001. American's capacity or
 AVAILABLE SEAT MILES (ASMs) of 39.0 billion miles decreased 2.6 percent compared
 to the first quarter of 2000. American's domestic traffic decreased 3.7 percent
 on a capacity decrease of 2.7 percent and international traffic increased 1.4
 percent on a capacity decrease of 2.4 percent. The decrease in domestic traffic
 was due to a slowing U.S. economy, softening the demand for air travel. The
 increase in international traffic was driven by a 6.9 percent increase in
 traffic to the Pacific on a capacity decrease of 3.5 percent, a 0.7 percent
 increase in traffic to Europe on a capacity increase of 0.1 percent and a 0.9
 percent increase in traffic to Latin America on a capacity decrease of 4.1
 percent. The overall decrease in capacity was due primarily to the Company's
 More Room Throughout Coach program, partially offset by an increase in the
 number of aircraft.
 
 The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES increased 8.7 percent, or $378 million.
 American's cost per ASM increased 11.7 percent to 11.21 cents, partially driven
 by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company's More Room Throughout Coach program.
 Adjusted for this program, American's cost per ASM grew approximately 5.7
 percent. WAGES, SALARIES AND BENEFITS increased 8.0 percent, or $129 million,
 primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees,
 contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the Company's
 labor contracts, partially offset by a decrease in provision for profit-sharing
 of approximately $28 million. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense increased 24.1 percent, or
 $133 million, due to a 21.5 percent increase in the Company's average price per
 gallon and a 2.2 percent increase in the Company's fuel consumption. The
 increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $47 million recognized
 during the first quarter of 2001 related to the Company's fuel hedging program.
 COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS decreased 12.8 percent, or $33 million, despite an
 increase of approximately 4.3 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to
 the continued benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and
 a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. Other operating
 expense increased 12.6 percent, or $101 million, due primarily to increases in
 external contract maintenance, outsourced services, data processing, and travel
 and incidental costs.
 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), historically a net expense, increased $19 million, or
 34.5 percent, due to an increase in interest income of $8 million, or 25.0
 percent, relating primarily to the Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA)
 debtor-in-possession financing which partially offsets approximately $21 million
 of SFAS 133 adjustments as a result of the Company's ineffectiveness and
 time-value adjustments associated with its fuel hedging program (see Footnote 6
 to the condensed consolidated financial statements) and an increase of $9
 million in miscellaneous-net relating primarily to the write-down of certain
 investments held by the Company.
 
 The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 were
 based upon the operating results for such periods. As such, the effective tax
 rates do not represent estimated annual effective tax rates.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES in the three-month period ended March
 31, 2001 was $19 million, a decrease of $502 million over the same period in
 2000, due primarily to a decrease in the Company's working capital and a
 decrease in income from continuing operations. Capital expenditures for the
 first three months of 2001 were $847 million, and included the acquisition of
 seven Boeing 737-800s, four Boeing 777-200ERs and seven Embraer 135 aircraft.
 These capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and
 debt agreements.
 
      As of March 31, 2001, the Company had commitments to acquire the following
 aircraft: 62 Boeing 737-800s, 23 Boeing 757-200s, 16 Boeing 777-200ERs, 145
 Embraer regional jets and 25 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries of all aircraft
 continue through 2006. Payments for all aircraft will approximate $2.1 billion
 during the remainder of 2001, $1.7 billion in 2002, $950 million in 2003 and an
 aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion in 2004 through 2006. The Company
 expects to fund its remaining 2001 capital expenditures from the Company's
 existing cash and short-term investments, internally generated cash or new
 financing depending upon market conditions and the Company's evolving view of
 its long-term needs.
 
 OTHER INFORMATION
 
 On January 10, 2001, the Company announced three transactions that would
 substantially increase the scope of its existing network. The first of these
 transactions was consummated on April 9, 2001 when the Company purchased
 substantially all of the assets of TWA for approximately $625 million in cash
 (subject to certain working capital adjustments), including the satisfaction of
 $312 million in debtor-in-possession financing, and assumed certain liabilities.
 The Company funded the acquisition of TWA's assets with its existing cash and
 short-term investments. The Company does not expect the acquisition of TWA to
 have a significantly accretive or dilutive impact on the Company's 2001
 earnings. Although TWA has historically reported net losses and the acquisition
 of TWA will result in the incurrence of integration costs, the Company expects
 to realize certain synergies from the acquisition, including, among other
 things, improved passenger revenues and a reduction in rental expense from the
 renegotiated lease obligations.
 
      Secondly, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire from United
 Airlines, Inc. (United) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)
 of US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways) upon the consummation of the previously
 announced merger between United and US Airways. In addition to the acquisition
 of these assets, American will lease a number of slots and gates from United so
 that American may operate half of the northeast Shuttle (New York/Washington
 DC/Boston). United will operate the other half of the Shuttle. For these assets,
 American will pay approximately $1.2 billion in cash to United and assume
 approximately $300 million in aircraft operating leases. The consummation of
 these transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed United/US
 Airways merger, which is no longer expected to occur in the second quarter of
 2001. Also, the acquisition of aircraft is dependent upon certain rights of
 United to exclude aircraft from the transactions and also is generally dependent
 upon a certain number of US Airways' Boeing 757 cockpit crew members
 transferring to American's payroll.
 
      Finally, American has agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to enter
 into an exclusive marketing agreement with, D.C. Air, LLC (DC Air). American has
 agreed to pay $82 million in cash for its ownership stake. American will have a
 right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent stake in
 DC Air. American will also lease to DC Air a certain number of Fokker 100
 aircraft with necessary crews (known in the industry as a "wet lease"). These
 wet leased aircraft will be used by DC Air in its operations. DC Air is the
 first significant new entrant at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)
 in over a decade. DC Air will acquire the assets needed to begin its DCA
 operations from United/US Airways upon the consummation of the merger between
 the two carriers. American's investment in DC Air and the other arrangements
 described above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger between
 United and US Airways and upon execution of definitive documentation between DC
 Air and United (which has not yet occurred).

      As a result of the above transactions, and for several other reasons,
 American and American Eagle have initiated an impairment review of certain fleet
 types in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
 Be Disposed Of." This review, which is expected to be completed during the
 second quarter of 2001, could result in an impairment charge to be taken by the
 Company. The size of any resulting 2001 charge is not presently known, but may
 be significant.
