                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
 OVERVIEW
 
      AT&T Corporation (AT&T) is among the world's communications leaders,
 providing voice, data, video and broadband telecommunications services to large
 and small businesses, consumers and government agencies. We provide domestic and
 international long distance; regional, local and wireless communications
 services; cable television and Internet communications services. We also provide
 directory and calling-card services to support our communications business.
 
 TRACKING STOCKS
 
      A tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to its holders
 based on the financial performance and economic value of the assets it tracks.
 Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock or
 Liberty Media Class A or B tracking stock does not represent a direct legal
 interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but an ownership of
 AT&T in total. The specific shares represent an interest in the economic
 performance of the net assets of each of the groups.
 
      AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated business of AT&T and Liberty Media
 Group is a combination of certain assets and businesses of AT&T, neither of
 which is a stand-alone entity. As AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group
 are tracking stocks of AT&T, separate financial statements are not required to
 be filed. We have provided the financial statements as exhibits to this document
 to provide additional disclosures to investors to allow them to assess the
 financial performance of AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group. Since the
 tracking stocks are governed by a common board of directors, the AT&T board of
 directors could make operational and financial decisions or implement policies
 that affect disproportionately the businesses of any group. For example, our
 board of directors may decide to transfer funds or to reallocate assets,
 liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups, without the consent
 of shareholders. All actions by the board of directors are subject to the board
 members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and not just to
 holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our charter, policy
 statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.
 
      Our board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forth in
 the tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretion of
 our board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-group agreement
 but without approval of our shareholders. In addition, the fact that we have
 separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests
 of the holders of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group common stock and
 Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
 conflict. Our board of directors would make any change or addition to the
 policies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, and
 would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
 in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to AT&T and all of our
 shareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interests
 and all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of our
 shares.
 
      You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our
 board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the future
 prospects of a tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.
 
 RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T
 
      On October 25, 2000, AT&T announced a restructuring plan designed to fully
 separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect the financial
 performance and economic value of each of AT&T's four major operating units.
 Upon completion of the plan, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband, AT&T Business and
 AT&T Consumer will all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.
 
      As part of the first phase of the restructuring plan, on April 18, 2001,
 AT&T announced details of an offer to exchange shares of AT&T common stock for
 shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. On the same date, AT&T Wireless
 Services, Inc., filed its initial registration statement in connection with the
 planned split-
 
                                         33
 <PAGE>   35
 
 off. Under the terms of the exchange offer, AT&T will issue 1.176 shares of AT&T
 Wireless Group tracking stock in exchange for each share of AT&T common stock
 validly tendered and not withdrawn, subject to specified conditions. Following
 the exchange offer and subject to receipt of specific conditions, AT&T plans to
 split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T. AT&T intends to retain up to $3 billion
 of AT&T Wireless shares for future sale, exchange or monetization within six
 months following the split-off. We expect AT&T Wireless will become an
 independent, publicly-held company in mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate tax
 and other approvals.
 
      In addition to the split-off of AT&T Wireless, we intend to fully separate
 or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial performance and
 economic value of each of our other major business units. We plan to create and
 issue new classes of stock to track the financial performance and economic value
 of our AT&T Broadband unit and AT&T Consumer unit. We plan to sell some
 percentage of shares of the AT&T Broadband unit in the fall of 2001. Within 12
 months of such sale, we intend to completely separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T,
 as an asset-based stock. The AT&T Consumer tracking stock is expected to be
 fully distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of 2001.
 
      AT&T expects that these transactions will be tax-free to U.S. shareholders.
 AT&T's restructuring plan is complicated and involves a substantial number of
 steps and transactions, including obtaining various conditions, such as Internal
 Revenue Services rulings. In addition, future financial conditions, superior
 alternatives or other factors may arise or occur that make it inadvisable to
 proceed with part or all of AT&T's restructuring plans. Any or all of the
 elements of AT&T's restructuring plan may not occur as we currently expect or in
 the timeframes that we currently contemplate, or at all. Alternative forms of
 restructuring, including sales of interests in these businesses, would reduce
 what is available for distribution to shareholders in the restructuring.
 
      On April 11, 2001, the Internal Revenue Services ruled that the proposed
 split-off of Liberty Media Corporation, which will own all of the assets
 reflected in the Liberty Media Group (LMG), qualifies as a tax-free transaction
 for AT&T, Liberty Media and their shareowners. AT&T acquired Liberty Media
 through the acquisition of Tele-Communications, Inc.(TCI). AT&T does not have a
 controlling financial interest for financial accounting purposes in LMG;
 therefore, our investment in LMG is accounted for under the equity method in the
 accompanying consolidated financial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG
 are reflected as separate line items "Equity earnings (losses) from Liberty
 Media Group" and "Investment in Liberty Media Group and related receivables,
 net," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
      By mid-2001, AT&T plans to convert the LMG tracking stock into an
 asset-based security and launch Liberty Media Corporation as an independent,
 publicly-traded company.
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
      This document may contain forward-looking statements with respect to AT&T's
 restructuring plan, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,
 dividends, financing plans, business strategies, operating efficiencies or
 synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, network build out and
 upgrade, competitive positions, availability of capital, growth opportunities
 for existing products, benefits from new technologies, availability and
 deployment of new technologies, plans and objectives of management, and other
 matters.
 
      These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those
 relating to the future business prospects, revenue, working capital, liquidity,
 capital needs, network build out, interest costs and income, are necessarily
 estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number
 of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
 from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
 statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important
 factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
 projections contained in the forward-looking statements including, without
 limitation:
 
      - the risks associated with the implementation of AT&T's restructuring
        plan, which is complicated and involves a substantial number of different
        transactions each with separate conditions, any or all of
 
                                         34
 <PAGE>   36
 
        which may not occur as we currently intend, or which may not occur in the
        timeframe we currently expect,
 
      - the risks associated with each of AT&T's main business units, operating
        as independent entities as opposed to as part of an integrated
        telecommunications provider following completion of AT&T's restructuring
        plan, including the inability of these groups to rely on the financial
        and operational resources of the combined company and these groups having
        to provide services that were previously provided by a different part of
        the combined company,
 
      - the impact of existing and new competitors in the markets in which these
        groups compete, including competitors that may offer less expensive
        products and services, desirable or innovative products, technological
        substitutes, or have extensive resources or better financing.
 
      - the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting from excessive deployment
        of network capacity,
 
      - the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in the
        telecommunications industry, which trend may have the effect of making
        the competitors of these entities larger and better financed and afford
        these competitors with extensive resources and greater geographic reach,
        allowing them to compete more effectively,
 
      - the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which the company
        operates, which may decrease prices charged, increase churn and change
        customer mix, profitability and average revenue per user,
 
      - the ability to enter into agreements to provide, and the cost of entering
        new markets necessary to provide, nationwide services,
 
      - the ability to establish a significant market presence in new geographic
        and service markets,
 
      - the availability and cost of capital and the consequences of increased
        leverage,
 
      - the successful execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic assets as
        part of an overall corporate deleveraging plan,
 
      - the potential impact of NTT DoCoMo's investment in AT&T, including
        provisions of the agreements that restrict AT&T Wireless Group's future
        operations, and provisions that may require AT&T to repurchase NTT
        DoCoMo's interest in AT&T if AT&T or AT&T Wireless Group fail to meet
        specified conditions,
 
      - the impact of any unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of the
        business strategies of the company,
 
      - the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to
        competitors by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or state
        regulatory commissions under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or other
        applicable laws and regulations,
 
      - the risks and costs associated with the need to acquire additional
        wireless spectrum for current and future services,
 
      - the risks associated with technological requirements, technology
        substitution and changes and other technological developments,
 
      - the results of litigation filed or to be filed against the company,
 
      - the possibility of one or more of the markets in which the company
        competes being impacted by changes in political, economic or other
        factors, such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other
        external factors over which these groups have no control, and
 
      - the risks related to AT&T's investments in LMG and joint ventures.

 through its senior management, may make forward-looking statements about the
 matters described in this document or other matters concerning AT&T.
 
      The discussion and analysis that follows provides information management
 believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of AT&T's consolidated
 results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, and financial
 condition as of March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000.
 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
      The comparison of first quarter 2001 results with the first quarter of 2000
 was impacted by events, such as acquisitions and dispositions, that occurred
 during these two years. For example, at year-end 2000, we acquired the wireless
 property in Los Angeles as a result of the AB Cellular redemption of AT&T's
 equity interest in AB Cellular. Prior to that date, AT&T held a 55.62% equity
 interest in AB cellular with 50% voting interest and recorded the investment
 under the equity method of accounting. The consolidation of the Los Angeles
 property resulted in the inclusion of 100% of its results in each line item of
 AT&T's Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2000 and the results were also
 included in AT&T's Consolidated Income Statements starting January 2001. In
 addition, in 2000, we acquired MediaOne and wireless properties in the San
 Francisco Bay area, which were both included in our first quarter 2001 results,
 but were not included in the first quarter 2000 results.
 
      Year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of At Home
 Corp. (Excite@Home) beginning September 1, 2000, due to corporate-governance
 changes, which gave AT&T a controlling interest. At that time and on March 31,
 2001, we had an approximate 23% economic interest and 74% voting interest in
 Excite@Home. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusion of 100%
 of its results in each line item of AT&T's Consolidated Balance Sheet and
 Consolidated Income Statement. The approximate 77% we do not own is reflected in
 the March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Consolidated Balance Sheets within
 "Minority Interest" and as a component of "Minority interest income (expense)"
 in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months ended March 31,
 2001. For the three months ended March 31, 2000, our ownership interest in
 Excite@Home was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with
 earnings or losses included as a component of "Net losses from other equity
 investments" in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
      Effectively July 1, 2000, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
 eliminated Primary Interexchange Carrier Charges (PICC or per-line charges) that
 AT&T pays for residential and single-line businesses. The elimination of these
 per-line charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue,
 since AT&T has historically billed its customers for these charges.

 </TABLE>
 
      Total revenue increased 5.4%, or $0.9 billion, in the first quarter of 2001
 compared with the prior year period. Approximately $1.0 billion of the increase
 is due to the impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home
 partially offset by the elimination of PICC and dispositions. Also contributing
 to the revenue growth was Wireless Services, data and Internet protocol (IP)
 growth within Business Services and Broadband. These increases were largely
 offset by the accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue. We
 
                                         36

 expect long distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing
 competition and product substitution.

      Costs of services and products increased $0.9 billion, or 23.6%, in the
 first quarter of 2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. Approximately
 $0.7 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions, primarily MediaOne, net of
 dispositions, and the impact of consolidating Excite@Home. The higher costs
 associated with new outsourcing contracts as well as our growing wireless
 subscriber base increased expenses by approximately $0.2 billion. The higher
 wireless expenses primarily related to higher costs of handsets sold due to an
 increase in gross subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001 compared
 with the same period in the prior year.

      Access and other connection expenses decreased 8.4%, to $3.3 billion in the
 first quarter of 2001, compared with $3.6 billion in the first quarter of 2000.
 Included within access and other connection expenses are costs that we pay to
 connect calls on the facilities of other service providers. Mandated reductions
 in per-minute access costs and decreased per-line charges effective in the
 second half of 2000 resulted in lower costs of approximately $0.5 billion. These
 decreases were partially offset by approximately $0.2 billion of higher costs
 due to volume increases, as well as higher Universal Service Fund contributions.
 Since most of these charges are passed through to the customer, the per-minute
 access-rate and per-line charge reductions and the Universal Service Fund
 contributions have generally resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue.

 Increased marketing, advertising and customer care in support of our growing
 Wireless and Broadband businesses drove approximately $0.3 billion of the
 increase. In addition, $0.4 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions,
 primarily MediaOne, net of dispositions, and the impact of consolidating
 Excite@Home. Partially offsetting these increases was cost savings of
 approximately $0.2 billion as a result of continued cost-control initiatives,
 primarily from our Consumer Services Business.

      Depreciation and other amortization expenses increased $0.6 billion, or
 36.8%, to $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2001 compared with the
 corresponding prior-year period. Approximately half of the increase was due to a
 higher asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment, and the
 remaining increase resulted from acquisitions activity, primarily MediaOne.
 Capital expenditures were $3.3 billion for the first

 primary focus for capital expenditures in 2001 continues to be on the core
 growth areas of wireless, broadband, data and IP, and local.

      Amortization of goodwill, franchise costs and other purchased intangibles
 increased $0.5 billion to $0.8 billion, or 129.6%, in the first quarter of 2001
 compared with the corresponding prior year period. This increase was largely
 attributable to acquisitions, primarily MediaOne, as well as the consolidation
 of Excite@Home.

 Net restructuring and other charges.........................   $808      $773
 </TABLE>
 
      During the first quarter of 2001, AT&T recorded $808 million of net
 restructuring and other charges, which had an approximate $0.21 impact on basic
 and diluted earnings per share. Included in these charges was $739 million for
 asset impairment charges related to Excite@Home, and $69 for restructuring and
 exit costs which consisted of $59 million for cash severance costs, $6 million
 related to facilities and $4 million related to termination of lease
 obligations.
 
      The asset impairment charges included $600 recorded by Excite@Home
 associated with goodwill impairment of various acquisitions, primarily Excite,
 and a related goodwill impairment charge of $139 recorded by AT&T associated
 with its acquisition goodwill of Excite@Home. The impairment resulted from the
 continued weakness of the online media market that Excite@Home operates in.
 Since we consolidate, but only own approximately 23% of Excite@Home, 77% of the
 charge recorded by Excite@Home was not included as a reduction to AT&T's net
 income, but rather eliminated in our March 31, 2001 Consolidated Statement of
 Income as "Minority interest income (expense)."
 
      The $59 million of cash severance costs were primarily recorded as a result
 of synergies created by the MediaOne merger related to approximately 2,350
 employees. Approximately 10% of the individuals were management employees and
 90% were non-management employees. Nearly 88% of the affected employees have
 left their positions as of March 31, 2001, and the remaining employees will
 leave the company by the end of 2001.
 
      This restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of
 approximately $42 million in 2001 (net of severance benefit pay-outs of
 approximately $59 million) and approximately $132 million per year thereafter,
 as well as EBIT savings of approximately $97 million in 2001 and approximately
 $101 million per year thereafter. We expect increased spending in growth
 businesses will largely offset these cash and EBIT savings. The EBIT savings,
 primarily attributable to reduced personnel-related expenses, will be realized
 in costs of services and products and SG&A expenses.
 
      In the second quarter of 2001, we expect to incur additional restructuring
 charges resulting from MediaOne synergies and work force reductions at
 Excite@Home.
 
      During the first quarter of 2000, AT&T recorded $773 million of net
 restructuring and other charges, which included $682 million for restructuring
 and exit costs associated with AT&T's initiative to reduce costs by the end of
 2000, and $91 million related to the government-mandated disposition of AT&T
 Communications (U.K.) Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert.
 Included in restructuring and exit costs was $458 million of cash termination
 benefits associated with the involuntary separation of approximately 6,200
 employees. Approximately one-half of the individuals were management employees
 and one-half were non-management employees. Nearly 60% of the affected employees
 have left their positions as of March 31, 2001, and the remaining employees will
 leave the company during 2001.

      We also recorded $62 million of network lease and other contract
 termination costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying
 vendors of the termination of these contracts during the quarter.
 
      Also included in restructuring and exit costs was $144 of benefit
 curtailment costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit
 plans. We also recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 related to the
 write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain businesses in which the carrying
 value is no longer supported by future cash flows.

 Operating Income............................................  $977     $2,402
 </TABLE>
 
      Operating income decreased $1.4 billion, or 59.4%, in the first quarter of
 2001 compared with the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to
 the impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of Excite@Home, which lowered
 operating income by nearly $1.1 billion. A majority of the impact of operating
 losses and the restructuring charge generated by Excite@Home was offset in
 minority interest income (expense), reflecting the approximate 77% of
 Excite@Home we do not own. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income
 was the impact of lower revenue in Consumer Services, and higher operating
 expenses for advanced Broadband services, including digital video, high-speed
 data and broadband telephony, partially offset by restructuring charges, net of
 asset impairment, recorded in the first quarter of 2000.

      Other (expense) income for the first quarter of 2001 was an expense of $0.8
 billion, compared with income of $0.7 billion in the first quarter of 2000, an
 increase in expense of $1.4 billion. Effective January 1, 2001, in conjunction
 with the adoption of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
 Hedging Activities," we reclassified certain investment securities, which
 support debt that is indexed to those securities, from "available-for-sale" to
 "trading." As a result of the reclassification, we recorded a pretax charge of
 $1.0 billion in other income. Also contributing to the increase in expense were
 lower net gains on sale of businesses and investments of approximately $0.4
 billion.

      Interest expense increased 64.6%, or $0.4 billion, in first quarter of 2001
 compared with the same period in 2000. The increase was primarily due to the
 higher average debt balance as a result of our June 2000 acquisition of
 MediaOne, including outstanding debt of MediaOne and debt issued to fund the
 MediaOne acquisition and debt issuance by AT&T Wireless in the quarter.

 Provision for income taxes..................................   $292      $509
 </TABLE>
 
      The provision for income taxes was $0.3 billion in the first quarter of
 2001 compared with $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2000. The decrease in
 expense was primarily due to a net loss before income taxes in the first quarter
 of 2001, compared with earnings before income taxes in the first quarter of
 2000. As AT&T recorded a tax provision despite having pretax losses for the
 first quarter of 2001, the effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative
 37.6%, compared with 20.5% for the first quarter of 2000. The first quarter 2001
 
                                         39
 <PAGE>   41
 
 effective tax rate was impacted by a charge associated with the adoption of SFAS
 No. 133, as well as a non tax-deductible asset impairment charge recorded
 related to Excite@Home. The first quarter of 2001 effective tax rate was also
 negatively impacted by the consolidation of operational losses of Excite@Home,
 which is unable to record tax benefits on its pretax losses, and higher non
 tax-deductible goodwill amortization. The first quarter 2000 effective tax rate
 was positively impacted by a tax-free gain resulting from an exchange of AT&T
 stock for an entity owning certain cable-systems and other assets with Cox, and
 the benefit of the write-off of the related deferred tax liability.

 Minority interest income (expense)..........................   $650      $(44)

      Minority interest income (expense), which is recorded net of income taxes,
 represents an adjustment to AT&T's income to reflect the less than 100%
 ownership of consolidated subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
 issued by subsidiaries of AT&T. The $0.7 billion decrease in minority interest
 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, as compared with the corresponding
 prior-year period resulted from the consolidation of Excite@Home effective
 September 1, 2000. The minority interest income in 2001 primarily reflects
 losses generated by Excite@Home, including an asset impairment charge that were
 attributable to the approximate 77% of Excite@Home not owned by AT&T. The income
 tax benefit recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $87 million and
 $26 million for the first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 Equity (losses) earnings from Liberty Media Group...........  $(697)    $942

      Equity losses from LMG, which are recorded net of income taxes, were $0.7
 billion in the first quarter of 2001, compared with earnings of $0.9 billion for
 the same period in 2000. The decline was primarily due to lower gains on
 dispositions, including gains associated with the mergers of various companies
 that LMG had investments in. Gains were recorded for the difference between the
 carrying value of LMG's interest in the acquired company and the fair value of
 securities received in the merger. In addition, the impairment charges recorded
 on LMG's investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value also
 contributed to the decline. These were partially offset by tax benefits recorded
 in the quarter associated with the net loss before cumulative accounting change
 compared with tax expense in the prior year quarter associated with net
 earnings.

      Net losses from other equity investments, which were recorded net of income
 taxes, were $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2001, a 27.0% decrease compared
 with the first quarter of 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the
 consolidation of Excite@Home and higher earnings related to Cablevision Systems
 Corp. reflecting a gain associated with the swap of cable properties, partially
 offset by higher losses from its normal business operations. Partially
 offsetting these decreases were higher equity losses from various investments
 including Concert, as well as equity earnings in the first quarter of 2000 from
 investments sold in 2000. The income tax benefit recorded on net losses from
 other equity investments were $102 million and $115 million for the first
 quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2000, respectively.

      Dividend requirements of preferred stock were $0.2 billion in the first
 quarter of 2001. The preferred stock dividend represented interest in connection
 with convertible preferred stock issued to NTT DoCoMo.

      Losses per diluted share attributable to the AT&T Common Stock Group were
 $0.10 in the first quarter of 2001 compared with EPS on a diluted basis of $0.54
 in the first quarter of 2000. The decrease was primarily driven by lower
 operating income, lower gains on the sales of businesses and investments, and
 the net impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133, which includes a $0.15 per share
 charge relating to the revaluation of certain securities reclassified from
 "available-for-sale" to "trading" recorded in other income and a net benefit of
 $0.09 per share relating to the cumulative effect of adoption. Also contributing
 to the decrease in earnings was increased interest expense, partially offset by
 higher minority interest income.

      Losses per diluted share attributable to Liberty Media Group (LMG) were
 $0.06 in the first quarter of 2001, compared with earnings of $0.37 on a diluted
 basis, in the first quarter of 2000. The decline was primarily due to lower
 gains on dispositions, including gains associated with the mergers of various
 companies that LMG had investments in. Gains were recorded for the difference
 between the carrying value of LMG's interest in the acquired company and the
 fair value of securities received in the merger. In addition, the impairment
 charges recorded on LMG's investments to reflect other than temporary declines
 in value also contributed to the decline. These were partially offset tax
 benefits recorded in the quarter associated with the net loss before cumulative
 accounting change compared with tax expense in the prior year quarter associated
 with net earnings as well as by the cumulative effect of the accounting changes
 due to the adoption of SFAS 133.
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS
 
      In support of the services we provide, we segment our results by the
 business units that support our primary lines of business: Business Services,
 Consumer Services, Wireless Services and Broadband. The balance of AT&T's
 operations, excluding LMG is included in a Corporate and Other category.
 Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG.
 
      The discussion of segment results includes revenue; EBIT (earnings before
 interest, taxes, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and dividend
 requirements on preferred stock); EBITDA [EBIT excluding depreciation and
 amortization, and minority interest (expense) income other than Excite@Home's
 minority (expense) interest]; total assets, and capital additions. The
 discussion of EBITDA for Wireless Services and Broadband is modified to exclude
 other income and net losses from equity investments. Total assets for each
 segment generally include all assets, except intercompany receivables. However,
 our Wireless Services segment included intercompany receivables from AT&T and
 the related interest income since these assets relate to the results of the AT&T
 Wireless Group tracked business. Prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or
 leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level, and therefore are
 included in the Corporate and Other group. Capital additions for each segment
 include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, acquisitions of
 licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
 and additions to internal-use software.
 
      EBIT is the primary measure used by AT&T's chief operating decision makers
 to measure AT&T's operating results and to measure segment profitability and
 performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as earnings before interest, taxes, the
 cumulative effect of accounting changes and dividend requirements on preferred
 stock. In addition, management also uses EBITDA as a measure of segment
 profitability and performance, and is defined as EBIT, excluding depreciation
 and amortization, minority interest (expense) income other than Excite@Home's
 minority (expense) interest. Interest and taxes are not factored into the
 segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision makers;
 therefore, trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis.
 Management believes EBIT is meaningful to investors because it provides analysis
 of operating results using the same measures used by AT&T's chief operating
 decision makers and provides a return on total capitalization measure. We
 believe EBITDA is meaningful to investors as a measure of each segment's
 liquidity consistent with the measure utilized by our chief operating decision
 makers. In addition, we believe that both EBIT and EBITDA allow investors a
 means to evaluate the financial results of each segment in relation to total
 AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was $0.5 billion and $2.7 billion for the quarters ended
 March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. EBITDA for AT&T was $3.5 billion and $4.8
 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Our
 calculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation
 of these measures by other public companies. EBIT and EBITDA should not be
 viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting
 principles (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash
 flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
 liquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain
 assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow.
 
      In connection with our corporate restructuring program set forth in late
 2000, our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes enacted since the
 publication of our 2000 annual results. The changes are as follows: The Business
 Services segment was expanded to include the results of international operations
 and
                                         42
 <PAGE>   44
 
 ventures. In addition, certain corporate costs that were previously recorded
 within the Corporate and Other Group have been allocated to the respective
 segments in an effort to ultimately have the results of these businesses reflect
 all direct corporate costs as well as overhead for shared services. All prior
 period results have been restated to reflect these changes. Total assets for our
 reportable segments generally include all asset, except intercompany
 receivables. However, our Wireless Services Segment included intercompany
 receivables from AT&T and the related interest income since these assets relate
 to the results of the AT&T Wireless Group tracked businesses.
 
      Reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continuously review our
 management model and structure, which may result in additional adjustments to
 our operating segments in the future. In addition, when we create tracking
 stocks for our Consumer and Broadband units, we will begin allocating 'pure'
 corporate overhead to these units. See note (b) for further detail on our
 restructuring plan.
 
 BUSINESS SERVICES
 
      Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications
 services, including long distance, local, and data and IP networking to small
 and medium-sized businesses, large domestic and multinational businesses and
 government agencies. Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IP
 transport to service resellers (wholesale services).
 
      Business Services includes AT&T Solutions, the company's
 professional-services outsourcing business, which provides seamless solutions
 that maximize the competitive advantage of networking-based electronic
 applications for global clients. AT&T Solutions also provides e-infrastructure
 and high-availability services to enterprise clients, and manages AT&T's unified
 global network. Business Services also includes the results of International
 ventures and operations.

 AT&T WIRELESS GROUP OVERVIEW
 
      AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated business of AT&T and is not a
 stand-alone entity. As AT&T Wireless Group is a tracking stock of AT&T, separate
 financial statements are not required to be filed. We have provided the
 financial statements as an exhibit to this document to provide additional
 disclosures to investors to allow them to assess the financial performance of
 AT&T Wireless Group. Since the tracking stocks are governed by a common board of
 directors, the AT&T board of directors could make operational and financial
 decisions or implement policies that affect disproportionately the businesses of
 any group. For example, our board of directors may decide to transfer funds or
 to reallocate assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows among
 groups, without the consent of shareholders. All actions by the board of
 directors are subject to the board members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders
 of AT&T as a group and not just to holders of a particular class of tracking
 stock and to our charter, policy statements, by-laws and inter-company
 agreements.
 
      AT&T's board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forth
 in the tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretion
 of our board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-group
 agreement but without approval of our shareholders. In addition, the fact that
 we have separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when the
 interests of the holders of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group tracking
 stock and Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to
 diverge or conflict. AT&T's board of directors would make any change or addition
 to the policies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our
 by-laws, and would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest
 among our groups, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to AT&T and
 all of our shareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent
 interests and all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate
 classes of our shares.
 
      You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our
 board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the future
 prospects of a tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.
 
      AT&T Wireless Group is a wireless telecommunications company which
 primarily provides domestic wireless voice and data services and products in the
 850 megahertz (cellular) and 1900 megahertz (Personal Communications Services,
 or PCS) markets. Additionally, AT&T Wireless Group offers wireless local
 telephone and internet services to residential customers through its Fixed
 Wireless business. AT&T Wireless Group also holds equity interests in various
 domestic and international wireless communications ventures and partnerships.
 
      On April 27, 2000, AT&T completed an offering of 15.6%, or 360 million
 shares, of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an offering price of $29.50 per
 share. AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock is a class of AT&T common stock, which
 is intended to provide holders with financial returns based on the financial
 performance and economic value of AT&T's wireless services' businesses. AT&T
 Wireless Group tracking stock issued in the offering reflected only a portion of
 the authorized shares. The remaining 84.4% was reserved for the benefit of AT&T
 Common Stock Group (which consists of the operations of AT&T other than those
 attributed to AT&T tracking stocks) and is intended to be reflected in AT&T
 common stock. See below for discussion of the investment by NTT DoCoMo which
 closed in January 2001. As a result of the DoCoMo investment, assuming
 conversion, AT&T Common Stock Group would retain an approximate 70% economic
 interest in AT&T Wireless Group.
 
      The combined financial statements of AT&T Wireless Group primarily include
 the legal entity results of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries
 (AWS) and AT&T Wireless Group, LLC (AWG), both of which were direct subsidiaries
 of AT&T Corp., as of March 31, 2001. AWG will be transferred to AWS prior to the
 split-off.
 
      On October 25, 2000, as part of its restructuring plan, AT&T announced its
 decision to present an exchange offer to AT&T common shareowners to allow them
 to exchange any portion of shares of AT&T common stock for shares of AT&T
 Wireless Group tracking stock, subject to pro-ration. AT&T released details of
 its exchange offer on April 18, 2001 and anticipates that the exchange offer
 will be completed during
                                         53
 <PAGE>   55
 
 the second quarter of 2001. Under the terms of the exchange offer, AT&T will
 issue 1.176 shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock in exchange for each
 share of AT&T common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn, subject to
 specified conditions. AT&T Wireless Group will continue to be a part of AT&T
 following the completion of the exchange offer. This exchange offer will result
 in an increase in the percentage of outstanding shares held by public
 shareholders and a decrease to the percentage reserved for the benefit of AT&T
 Common Stock Group.
 
      In connection with its restructuring plan, following the completion of the
 exchange offer and subject to certain conditions, AT&T intends to split-off AT&T
 Wireless Group from AT&T. These conditions include the receipt of a favorable
 ruling on the split-off from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and satisfaction
 of conditions contained in an AT&T credit agreement, including the repayment of
 AT&T Wireless Group's intercompany obligations to AT&T.
 
      On April 18, 2001, AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., filed its initial
 registration statement in connection with the planned split-off. The split-off,
 which is anticipated to be completed in mid-2001, will include several steps.
 These steps include transferring substantially all of the assets and liabilities
 of AT&T Wireless Group to AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., mandatorily exchanging
 all issued and outstanding shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock,
 including those shares issued in the exchange offer as well as the shares held
 by DoCoMo, for shares of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. common stock, and
 distributing a majority of the shares of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. common
 stock held by AT&T Common Stock Group, to holders of AT&T common stock on a pro
 rata basis. AT&T intends to retain up to $3 billion of AT&T Wireless Services,
 Inc. common stock for its own account for sale or exchange within six months of
 the split-off, subject to receipt of a satisfactory IRS ruling.
 
 DOCOMO INVESTMENT
 
      In January 2001, NTT DoCoMo, a leading Japanese wireless communications
 company, invested $9.8 billion in a security of AT&T that, like AT&T Wireless
 Group tracking stock, is intended to reflect a portion of the financial
 performance and economic value of AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T Wireless Group,
 through AWS and AWG, was allocated $6.2 billion of the gross proceeds from
 DoCoMo's $9.8 billion investment in AT&T. Additionally, AT&T Wireless Group was
 allocated $18 of costs associated with the transaction. AT&T retained the
 remaining $3.6 billion of the DoCoMo investment proceeds as consideration for
 the reduction in AT&T's retained portion of AT&T Wireless Group's value.
 Following the split-off, this investment will be converted into approximately
 16% of AT&T Wireless Services' common shares. DoCoMo also received warrants at
 an exercise price of $35 per AT&T Wireless Group tracking share equivalent that
 would represent an approximate additional 1.6% of AT&T Wireless Services' common
 shares after the split-off. As part of this investment, AT&T Wireless Group,
 through AWS, has entered into a strategic alliance with DoCoMo to develop mobile
 multimedia services on a global-standard, high-speed wireless network. DoCoMo
 may require the repurchase of its investment at DoCoMo's original purchase
 price, plus interest, if AT&T does not complete the split-off by specified dates
 beginning January 1, 2002, or if AT&T Wireless Group fails to meet specified
 technological milestones.
 
 AT&T WIRELESS GROUP FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
      Except for the historical statements and discussions contained herein,
 statements herein constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
 Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934, including without limitation, statements concerning future

 AT&T WIRELESS GROUP COMBINED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
   For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2001 Compared with the Three Months Ended
 March 31, 2000
 
      Revenue
 
      Total revenue includes wireless voice and data services, the sale of
 handsets and accessories, and revenue associated with the aviation
 communications and fixed wireless operations. AT&T Wireless Group records
 revenue as services are provided or when the product is sold. Services revenue
 primarily includes monthly recurring charges, airtime and toll usage charges,
 and roaming charges billed to subscribers for usage outside of AT&T Wireless
 Group's network as well as charges billed to other wireless providers for
 roaming on AT&T Wireless Group's network. The revenue and related expenses
 associated with the sales of wireless handsets and accessories are recognized
 when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer, as this is
 considered to be a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services.
 
      Total revenue increased 46.2% to $3,212 million for the three months ended
 March 31, 2001, compared with the same period in the prior year. Total revenue
 increased 25.7% for the three months ended March 30, 2001, compared with the
 same period for 2000, when adjusted to exclude the impact of the Bay Area
 Properties and the Los Angeles market for the three months ended March 31, 2001.
 
      The revenue increase for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was
 primarily due to growth in our mobility business services revenue, driven by
 strong consolidated subscriber growth, which was slightly offset by a decline in
 the average monthly revenue per user (ARPU).
 
      Services revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was $2,931
 million, an increase of $939 million, or 47.2%, compared with the respective
 period in 2000.
 
      As of March 31, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group's Mobility business had over 15.7
 million consolidated subscribers, an increase of 57.7%, compared with the prior
 year, including approximately 3 million subscribers associated with acquisitions
 that closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. Net consolidated wireless
 subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001 totaled 585 thousand, a 40.0%
 increase over the prior year quarter. AT&T Wireless Group's average monthly
 churn rate in the first quarter of 2001 was 3.0% compared with 2.9% in the first
 quarter of 2000.
 
      AT&T Wireless Group's ARPU for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was
 $62.20, an decrease of $5.00, or 7.4%, compared with the same period in 2000.
 The decline in ARPU is primarily a result of competitive pricing pressures,
 expansion into a broader base of consumer segments, including prepaid wireless,
 and the impact of acquisitions which closed subsequent to the first quarter of
 2000.
 
      Equipment revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was $281
 million, an increase of $75 million, or 36.6%, compared with the same period in
 2000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in gross consolidated
 subscriber additions in the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared with the
 same period in 2000. AT&T Wireless Group supplies to its subscribers a selection
 of handsets at competitive prices, which are generally offered at or below cost.
 
      Costs of services
 
      Costs of services include the costs to place calls over the network
 (including the costs to operate and maintain AT&T Wireless Group's network as
 well as roaming costs paid to other wireless providers) and the charges paid to
 connect calls on other networks, including those of AT&T. Additionally, costs of
 services includes provision for uncollectible receivables, as well as non-income
 related taxes.
 
      Costs of services for the three months ended March 31, 2001, were $921
 million, an increase of $259 million, or 39.3%, for the three months ended March
 31, 2001, compared with the same period in 2000. Approximately one-third of the
 increase was due to an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables,
 which resulted from a change in the mix of the subscriber base as a result of
 broadening AT&T Wireless Group's market segments. Additionally, another one-half
 of the increase was due to an increase in charges paid to connect calls on other
 networks, including AT&T's, as well as an increase in the costs to maintain the
 AT&T Wireless Group's network. These increases were driven by growth in
 subscriber base and the related increased minutes of use.
 
                                         55
 <PAGE>   57
 
      Costs of equipment sales
 
      Costs of equipment sales include the costs of the handsets and accessories
 provided to AT&T Wireless Group customers. Costs of equipment sales for the
 three months ended March 31, 2001 were $490 million, an increase of $99 million,
 or 25.2%, compared with the same period in 2000. This increase was due entirely
 to higher equipment sales, as well as an increase in handset subsidies resulting
 from the increase in gross subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001
 compared with the first quarter of 2000.
 
      Selling, general and administrative
 
      Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
 March 31, 2001, were $1,084 million compared with $750 million for the three
 months ended March 31, 2000. Approximately forty percent of the increase was
 attributable to higher marketing and selling costs, including advertising and
 commissions, associated with the increase in gross consolidated subscriber
 additions for the three months ended March 31, 2001. Cost per gross subscriber
 addition, which includes the cost of handset subsidies recorded in costs of
 equipment sales in the accompanying combined statement of operations, was $327
 for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared with $360 for the three
 months ended March 31, 2000. In addition, approximately one-third of the
 increase was the result of growth in the wireless subscriber customer base and
 the related increases in customer care and billing costs.
 
      Depreciation and amortization
 
      Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended March 31,
 2001, were $576 million, an increase of $207 million, or 56.1%, compared with
 the three months ended March 31, 2000. The increase primarily resulted from the
 growth in the AT&T Wireless Group's depreciable asset base resulting from
 capital expenditures and property, plant and equipment acquired with
 acquisitions that closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. Additionally,
 effective January 1, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group shortened the depreciable lives
 of certain wireless communications equipment which resulted in approximately $36
 million of additional depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31,
 2001. Total capital expenditures were $1,252 million for the three months ended
 March 31, 2001. Amortization expense increased from the prior year quarter as a
 result of an increase in the amortization expense of licensing costs, goodwill,
 and other acquisition related intangibles as a result of acquisitions that
 closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. As a result of AT&T Wireless
 Group's evaluation of recent changes in the wireless telecommunications industry
 and the views of regulatory authorities, effective January 1, 2001, AT&T
 Wireless Group will use an amortization period for all licensing costs and
 goodwill associated with newly acquired wireless operations not to exceed 25
 years. This change did not have a material impact to AT&T Wireless Group's
 results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001.
 
      Other income
 
      Other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges of
 assets and intercompany interest income on the note receivable from AT&T. Other
 income for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was $84 million compared with
 $24 million for the respective period in 2000. The increase was due primarily to
 $77 million of intercompany interest income on the note receivable from AT&T for
 the first quarter of 2001.
 
      Interest expense
 
      Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on long-term debt
 to others and intercompany debt due to AT&T, less interest expense capitalized.
 Interest expense for the first quarter of 2001, was $47 million, a decrease of
 $4 million, or 6.8%, compared with the first quarter of 2000. The decrease was
 primarily due to lower levels of average outstanding debt due to AT&T.
 Additionally, capitalized interest increased as a result of increased capital
 expenditures. These decreases were offset by interest expense associated with
 the $6.5 billion of Senior Notes issued by AWS in March 2001.
 
      Provision (benefit) for income taxes
 
      The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended March
 31, 2001, was a provision of $79 million compared with $2 million of benefit for
 the same period in 2000. The increase was due primarily to
 
                                         56
 <PAGE>   58
 
 the increase in income before net equity earnings (losses) in the current year
 quarter compared with the prior year quarter. The effective income tax rate for
 the three months ended March 31, 2001, was 44.4% and was primarily impacted by
 goodwill associated with acquisitions that closed during 2000. Excluding a
 one-time gain recorded in the first quarter of 2000, the effective income tax
 rate for the prior year quarter was 48.9% and was also impacted primarily by
 goodwill associated with the 2000 acquisitions.
 
      Net equity (losses) earnings from investments
 
      Net equity (losses) earnings from investments, net of tax, were $99 million
 of losses for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared with $25 million
 of earnings for the respective period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to
 equity earnings from CMT Partners and AB Cellular during the first quarter of
 2000. AT&T Wireless Group acquired the remaining interest in CMT partners that
 they did not own in June 2000, and therefore, this entity was consolidated
 subsequent to the acquisition. Additionally, AT&T Wireless Group's equity
 interest in AB Cellular was redeemed in December 2000. In addition, equity
 losses increased associated with AT&T Wireless Group's affiliate and
 international investments in the first quarter of 2001 compared with the first
 quarter of 2000.
 
      Dividend requirements on preferred stock held by AT&T
 
      At March 31, 2001, and December 31, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group had
 outstanding, $3.0 billion of preferred stock held by AT&T that pays dividends at
 9% per annum. Dividend requirements on this preferred stock for the three months
 ended March 31, 2001 were $42 million compared with $13 million for the
 respective period in 2000, net of amounts recorded in accordance with the tax
 sharing agreement. The increase was a result of the May 1, 2000,
 recapitalization of $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to
 AT&T into an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held by
 AT&T.
 
 AT&T WIRELESS GROUP LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
      Currently, financing activities for AT&T Wireless Group are managed by AT&T
 on a centralized basis and are subject to the review of AT&T Wireless Group's
 capital stock committee. The AT&T Wireless Group capital stock committee is
 selected by AT&T's board of directors to oversee the interaction between
 businesses of AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T Wireless Group in accordance with
 the AT&T Wireless Group Policy Statement. Under the AT&T Wireless Group Policy
 Statement, all material transactions between AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T
 Wireless Group are determined and governed by a process of fair dealing. Sources
 for AT&T Wireless Group's future financing requirements may include the
 borrowing of funds, including additional short-term floating rate debt from AT&T
 prior to the split-off, and/or third-party debt. Loans from AT&T to any member
 of AT&T Wireless Group have been made at interest rates and on other terms and
 conditions intended to be substantially equivalent to the interest rates and
 other terms and conditions that AT&T Wireless Group would be able to obtain from
 third parties, including the public markets, as a non-affiliate of AT&T without
 the benefit of any guaranty by AT&T. This policy contemplates that these loans
 will be made on the basis set forth above regardless of the interest rates and
 other terms and conditions on which AT&T may have acquired the funds. If,
 however, AT&T incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available funds for
 use by AT&T Wireless Group, those fees or charges will be allocated to AT&T
 Wireless Group.
 
      AT&T's board of directors has the power to make determinations that may
 impact the financial and liquidity position of each of the tracking stock
 groups. This power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital and
 debt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions
 regarding whether to make capital expenditures and as to the timing and amount
 of any capital expenditures. All actions by the board of directors are subject
 to the board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and
 not just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our policy
 statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. As a result of this discretion
 of AT&T's board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess each
 group's liquidity and capital resource needs and in turn the future prospects of
 each group based on past performance.
 
      The continued expansion of AT&T Wireless Group's network and footprint,
 including spectrum auctions and the marketing and distribution of its products
 and services, will continue to require substantial capital.

 Prior to 2001, AT&T Wireless Group funded its operations with proceeds from the
 April 2000 offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock attributed from AT&T,
 intercompany borrowings from AT&T, internally generated funds, as well as
 capital contributions from AT&T prior to the April 2000 offering. Capital
 contributions from AT&T prior to the April 2000 offering included acquisitions
 made by AT&T that have been attributed to AT&T Wireless Group. Noncash capital
 contributions from AT&T to AT&T Wireless Group related to acquisitions and
 initial investments funded by AT&T totaled $552 million for the three months
 ended March 31, 2000.
 
      The April 2000 offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted in
 net proceeds to AT&T after deducting underwriter's discount and related fees and
 expenses of $10.3 billion. AT&T attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds to
 AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany note receivable, which was
 repaid by December 31, 2000, and was used primarily to fund acquisitions and
 capital expenditures.
 
      On May 1, 2000, in conjunction with the offering, AT&T Wireless Group
 recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to AT&T into
 an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held by AT&T. In
 conjunction with the recapitalization, AT&T Wireless Group's long-term debt due
 to AT&T was recapitalized to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a fixed
 rate of 8.1% per annum.
 
      On January 22, 2001, AT&T closed their transaction with NTT DoCoMo. AT&T
 attributed $6.1 billion of the approximate $9.8 billion of net proceeds received
 from the DoCoMo investment to AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany
 note receivable. AT&T Wireless Group intends to utilize the proceeds to continue
 executing their strategy to expand their capacity, enlarge their footprint,
 create an advanced mobile internet and invest in other strategic growth
 initiatives, as well as to satisfy intercompany obligations. It is intended that
 any outstanding balance on the intercompany note receivable will be repaid by
 AT&T prior to the split-off.
 
      On March 6, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWS, completed a private
 placement of $6.5 billion in unsecured and unsubordinated Senior Notes with
 maturity dates from March 1, 2006 to March 1, 2031. The notes pay interest at
 fixed rates ranging from 7.350% to 8.750% per annum, payable semi-annually and
 include customary covenants. The notes include registration rights, such that
 AWS is required to exchange the notes for a new issue of notes registered under
 the Securities Act of 1933 and are to be declared effective no later than 240
 days after the issue date. AT&T Wireless Group had $38 of interest expense for
 the quarter ended March 31, 2001 related to those notes.
 
      On March 23, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWS, entered into
 Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facilities (the "Facilities") in the
 aggregate amount of $2.5 billion consisting of an up to $1.25 billion 364-day
 Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility and an up to $1.25 billion
 Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility. The Facilities are
 subject to a facility fee ranging from 8 to 30 basis points, payable quarterly
 on the total commitment, used or unused. The facility fees are based on the
 respective agreement and will fluctuate based on AT&T Wireless Group's Senior
 Notes rating. The Facilities are also subject to a utilization fee of 12.5 basis
 points if borrowings exceed certain levels as defined in the agreement. The
 Facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases, (i)
 LIBOR plus 32.5 to 100 basis points depending on AT&T Wireless Group's Senior
 Notes rating, or (ii) the greater of the prime rate or the Federal funds
 effective rate plus 50 basis points. The Facilities are to be used for general
 corporate purposes and are subject to customary covenants, representations and
 warranties and events of default. In addition, the Facilities contain financial
 covenants requiring AT&T Wireless Group to maintain certain financial ratios and
 prohibit AWS from declaring and/or paying dividends prior to the split-off. The
 Facilities also specifies limitations on AT&T's and AT&T Wireless Group's
 ability to consummate the split-off including a provision that it will
 constitute an event of default if the split-off is consummated without obtaining
 a favorable tax ruling from the IRS or an unqualified tax opinion that the
 split-off will qualify as a tax-free transaction. In addition, the existence of
 an obligation by AT&T Wireless Group to repurchase equity interests from DoCoMo
 may under certain circumstances constitute an event of default. No amounts had
 been borrowed under the Facilities at March 31, 2001.
 
      In association with the intended split-off of AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T
 announced on October 25, 2000, AT&T and AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. anticipate
 that they will enter into a separation and distribution agreement that will
 govern the terms of the split-off. As part of this agreement, AT&T
                                         58
 <PAGE>   60
 
 Wireless Services will agree, upon completion of the split-off, to repay the
 full amount of the principal and accrued but unpaid interest or face value and
 accrued but unpaid dividends, of all outstanding indebtedness owned by AT&T
 Wireless Group to AT&T, and all preferred stock in AT&T Wireless Group held by
 AT&T.
 
      AT&T performs cash management functions on behalf of AT&T Wireless Group.
 Substantially all of AT&T Wireless Group's cash balances are swept to AT&T on a
 daily basis, where they are managed and invested by AT&T. Prior to the offering
 of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock, transfers of cash to and from AT&T were
 reflected as a component of combined attributed net assets, with no interest
 income or expense reflected. Subsequent to the offering, transfers are reflected
 as changes in the note receivable from or short-term debt payable to AT&T. Cash
 balances maintained and reported by AT&T Wireless Group primarily represent cash
 balances for which no right of offset exists with AT&T.
 
      Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March
 31, 2001, was $655 million, compared with $228 million for the same period in
 2000. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to
 a $322 million increase in operating income excluding depreciation and
 amortization, resulting from revenue growth and expense leveraging as well as an
 increase in deferred income taxes. These increases were partially offset by a
 larger decrease in payroll and benefit related liabilities for the three months
 ended March 31, 2001, compared with the prior year. Net cash used in investing
 activities for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was $12,519 million,
 compared with $948 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. The
 increase was due primarily to the issuance of a note receivable from AT&T
 totaling $10,588 million, increased contributions into equity investments, and
 higher capital expenditures to upgrade and increase network capacity. Net cash
 provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was
 $11,836 million, compared with $725 million for the three months ended March 31,
 2000. The increase was primarily due to the $6.1 billion of net proceeds from
 the DoCoMo investment that AT&T attributed to AT&T Wireless Group, as well as
 the $6.3 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes,
 partially offset by the repayment of the $638 million of short-term debt due to
 AT&T.
 
      EBITDA, defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, is
 the primary measure used by the chief operating decision-makers to measure our
 ability to generate cash flow. EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the
 calculation of EBITDA for other public companies and should not be viewed by
 investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles,
 measures of performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing
 activities as a measure of liquidity.
 
      EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2001, was $717 million compared
 with $395 million for the same period in 2000. The increase was primarily the
 result of growth in services revenue, partially offset by increased customer
 acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross consolidated subscriber
 additions, increased network costs attributable to subscriber growth and the
 related minutes of use, increased provision for uncollectible receivables, and
 increased customer care and billing related expenses to support growth in the
 subscriber base.
 
      For the Mobility business, EBITDA for the three months ended March 31,
 2001, was $788 million compared with $431 million for the same period in 2000.
 
      For the Fixed Wireless business, EBITDA for the three months ended March
 31, 2001, was a deficit of $68 million compared with a deficit of $34 million
 for the same period in 2000.
 
      EBITDA margin, defined as EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue, was
 22.3% for the first quarter of 2001, compared with 18.0% for the first quarter
 of 2000. The improvement in EBITDA margin was primarily due to revenue growth
 and expense leveraging, primarily off-network roaming expenses, partially offset
 by increased provision for uncollectible receivables.
 
      EBITDA margin for the Mobility business was 24.5% for the first quarter of
 2001 compared with 19.6% for the first quarter of 2000.
 
 AT&T WIRELESS GROUP FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
      Total assets were $47,039 million as of March 31, 2001, an increase of
 $11,737 million, or 33.2%, compared with December 31, 2000. The increase was due
 primarily to an increase in the intercompany note receivable from AT&T of
 $10,588 million which resulted from AT&T attributing $6.1 billion of the DoCoMo
                                         59
 <PAGE>   61
 
 investment net proceeds to AT&T Wireless Group, and AT&T Wireless Group loaning
 the $6.3 billion of net proceeds from the Senior Notes to AT&T. Partially
 offsetting these proceeds were the repayment of the $638 million of short-term
 debt due to AT&T, as well as capital expenditures and contributions made to non-
 consolidated investments during the first quarter of 2001.
 
      Total liabilities were $16,060 million as of March 31, 2001, an increase of
 $5,676 million, or 54.7%, compared with December 31, 2000. The increase was
 primarily due to the issuance of the $6.5 billion of Senior Notes, as well as
 increased operating accruals, partially offset by the repayment of $638 million
 of short-term debt due to AT&T, and decreases in payroll and benefit related
 liabilities and accounts payable.
 
      Total combined attributed net assets was $30,937 million as of March 31,
 2001, an increase of $6,606 million, or 24.4%, compared with December 31, 2000.
 The increase was primarily due to AT&T's attribution of the $6.1 billion of
 DoCoMo investment net proceeds to AT&T Wireless Group.
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
      In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
 Extinguishments of Liabilities -- A Replacement of FASB No. 125". This statement
 provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of
 financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. Under these standards,
 after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and
 servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes
 financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities
 when extinguished. This statement provides consistent standards for
 distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that
 are secured borrowings. This statement is effective for transfers and servicing
 of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31,
 2001. AT&T Wireless Group does not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 140 will
 have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash
 flows.
 
 AT&T WIRELESS GROUP SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
      On April 27, 2001, AT&T completed the sale of its entire interest in Japan
 Telecom for approximately $1.35 billion in cash. AT&T attributed $.5 billion of
 the net after-tax proceeds from the sale to AT&T Wireless Group. AT&T Wireless
 Group recognized an after-tax gain of $298 million associated with the
 transaction, which was recorded in net equity earnings from investments in the
 second quarter of 2001.
 
      During the first quarter of 2001, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWS, made
 unsecured term loans to Rogers Wireless to pay for spectrum it successfully bid
 upon in the recently completed Canadian spectrum auctions. In April 2001, Rogers
 Wireless effected a rights offering of its equity securities in which AT&T
 Wireless Group's joint venture with British Telecommunications, JVII,
 participated. The participation increased JVII's ownership interest in Rogers
 Wireless to 34.36%. AT&T Wireless Group funded the purchase on behalf of JVII by
 offsetting it against the unsecured, interest bearing note made by AWS. This
 transaction resulted in AT&T Wireless Group obtaining a controlling interest of
 JVII, as well as increasing the indirect ownership percentage in Rogers
 Wireless. As a result of the consolidation of JVII, which holds the equity
 interest in Rogers Wireless, AT&T Wireless Group's investments in unconsolidated
 subsidiaries, as well as minority interest liability, increased approximately
 $420 million in April 2001.
