         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
          The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
 accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
 footnotes included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, as well as the
 consolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management's discussion
 and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company's
 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 1998.
 
 ACQUISITIONS
 
          On March 30, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
 acquired approximately 81% of the total number of then outstanding shares of
 common stock of Coleman from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes ("M&F"), in
 exchange for 14,099,749 shares of the Company's common stock and approximately
 $160 million in cash. In addition, the Company assumed approximately $1,016
 million in debt. Immediately thereafter, as a result of the exercise of Coleman
 employee stock options, Sunbeam's indirect beneficial ownership of Coleman
 decreased to approximately 79% of the total number of the outstanding shares of
 Coleman common stock. The Company's agreement for the acquisition of the
 remaining publicly held Coleman shares pursuant to a merger transaction provides
 that the remaining Coleman shareholders will receive:
 
      o        approximately 6.7 million shares of Sunbeam common stock (0.5677
               of a share for each outstanding Coleman share); and,
 
      o        approximately $87 million in cash ($6.44 for each outstanding
               Coleman share and the cash-out of unexercised Coleman employee
               stock options for an amount equal to the difference between $27.50
               per share and the exercise price of such options).
 
          The Company expects to complete the Coleman merger during the second
 half of 1999, although there can be no assurance that the merger will occur
 during that time. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 for information regarding the settlement claims relating to the Coleman
 acquisition, the terms of which provide for the issuance at the time of the
 merger of warrants to purchase up to 4.98 million shares of Sunbeam's common
 stock at $7 per share.
 
          On April 6, 1998, the Company completed the cash acquisitions of First
 Alert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and
 Signature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.
 The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued at
 approximately $182 million (including $133 million of cash and $49 million of
 assumed debt) and approximately $255 million (reflecting cash paid, including
 the required retirement or defeasance of debt), respectively.
 
          The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting
 and accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of each
 acquired entity are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 from the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired
 entities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities
 assumed based on estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisals
 at the dates of acquisition.

 First Alert from the beginning of 1998 to their respective acquisition dates.
 The combined historical results do not include pro forma purchase accounting
 adjustments including those relating to the amortization of the purchase price
 of these acquisitions. Certain amounts included in the historical results of the
 acquired companies have been reclassified to conform with the Company's
 presentation. Presentation of these combined results is to enhance comparability
 between the periods presented and not necessarily indicative of the combined
 results that would have occurred had these acquisitions been consummated at the
 beginning of 1998.
 
 PROVISION FOR INVENTORY
 
          In the second quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a charge of $84.0
 million as a result of the following:
 
      o        Inventories were built during 1997 and the first half of 1998 in
               anticipation of 1998 sales volumes which did not materialize. As a
               result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose
               of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost.
               Accordingly, in the second quarter of 1998, when the facts and
               circumstances were known that such sales volume would not
               materialize, the Company recorded $46.4 million in charges to
               properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. This
               inventory primarily related to certain appliances, grills and
               grill accessories.
 
      o        A charge of $11.0 million was recorded during the second quarter
               of 1998 for excess inventories for raw material and work in
               process that will not be used due to outsourcing the production of
               breadmakers, toasters, and certain other appliances.
 
      o        In the second quarter of 1998, the Company made the decision to
               exit certain product lines, primarily air and water filtration
               products and eliminate certain stock keeping units ("SKU's")
               within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances,
               grills and grill accessories. As a result of this decision, a
               $26.6 million charge was recorded during the second quarter of
               1998 to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or
               market.
 
          These charges to record excess inventories at the
 lower-of-cost-or-market were based upon management's best estimate of net
 realizable value. (See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
                                        21
 
 <PAGE>
          In addition to the charge taken in 1998, the excess and obsolete
 inventory referenced above has impacted the Company's operating results in
 several ways, with two primary effects. First, gross margins have been impacted
 by sales, at below normal prices, of obsolete inventory into non-traditional
 channels and excess inventory into traditional channels. In addition, due to the
 high levels of excess inventory at the end of 1998, the Company's usage of its
 manufacturing facilities has been lower than normal, resulting in lower gross
 margins in 1999.
 
 ASSET IMPAIRMENT
 
          Management made decisions to outsource or discontinue a substantial
 number of products previously made by the Company (principally breadmakers,
 toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtration products and the
 elimination of certain SKU's within existing product lines, primarily relating
 to appliances, grills and grill accessories). As a result, certain facilities
 and equipment would either no longer be used or would be utilized in a
 significantly different manner. Accordingly, a charge of $29.6 million was
 recorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write certain of these assets down to their
 estimated fair market value. (See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
 PURCHASE ACCOUNTING
 
          The Company recorded the 1998 acquisitions using the purchase method of
 accounting. In accordance with this accounting method, inventory pertaining to
 the acquisitions was recorded at fair value. The fair value of the inventory
 exceeded the book value reflected on the balance sheets of the acquired
 companies as of the respective acquisition dates. The excess of the fair value
 of inventory over its pre-acquisition book value was recorded in cost of sales
 as the inventory was sold. The adjustment above removes this non-recurring
 impact ($20.5 million).
 
 FORMER EMPLOYEES' DEFERRED COMPENSATION
 
          On February 20, 1998, the Company entered into new three-year
 employment agreements with its then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two
 other senior officers of the Company. The new employment agreements provided
 for, among other items, the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and the
 forfeiture of unvested restricted stock that had been granted under the
 executives' prior employment agreements, new restricted stock grants and options
 to purchase common shares. Total compensation expense recognized in the first
 quarter of 1998 related to these items was approximately $31 million. (See Note
 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1999 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998
 
          Consolidated net sales for the three months ended June 30, 1999 and
 1998 were $660.9 million and $578.5 million respectively, an increase of $82.4
 million or approximately 14%. This increase was driven primarily by the Outdoor
 Leisure group where net sales increased $53.6 million to $338.1 million in the
 second quarter of 1999. This increase was predominately driven by strong retail
 replenishment demand of outdoor recreation products and Powermate/registered
 trademark/ generators (aggregating approximately $51 million). The increase in
 outdoor recreation products and Powermate/registered trademark/ generators is
 believed to be partially attributable to heightened consumer sensitivity to the
 need for emergency preparedness. This increased sensitivity is believed to be
 reflective of a combination of factors including weather conditions and Year
 2000 considerations. Outdoor cooking product net sales increased approximately
 $9 million in the 1999 period as compared to the second quarter of 1998, largely
 as a result of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter to allow trade
 inventories to return to appropriate levels. This factor affects the year to
 year comparisons for each of the operating groups. These improvements were
 partially offset by weaknesses in net sales of Eastpak/registered trademark/
 products. Household net sales increased $17.4 million to $151.3 million in 1999.
 Despite the lack of significant new product introductions, overall net sales of
 appliances, personal care, and health products increased approximately $14
 million as a result of a strengthening retail environment in the current year
 and the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter. During 1998 sales
 of coffee makers and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors were adversely effected
 by the disruption that arose from the integration with Sunbeam and the related
 management changes. Results for the second quarter of 1999 reflect improvement
 in the sales of coffee makers and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
 (approximately $3 million) from the prior year quarter, accounting for the
 remaining increase. International net sales increased $11.6 million to $165.7
 million. The increase in net sales was largely driven by improved net sales in
 Canada of approximately $10 million, resulting predominantly from strong retail
 demand for Powermate/registered trademark/ and outdoor recreation products and
 the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter, as discussed above. In
 addition, net sales increased in Europe and Japan by approximately $5 million in
 the second quarter of 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998, partially
 offset by declining net sales of the Company's products in Latin America. The
 Company believes that weak economic conditions contributed to the decline in
 Latin American net sales.
 
                                        22
 <PAGE>
          Gross margin for the second quarter in 1999 was $170.3 million or
 $222.8 million higher than the comparable period in 1998. Excluding the effects
 of 1998 non-recurring adjustments, as summarized above under "1998 Charges",
 gross margin for 1998 was $81.6 million in the second quarter of 1998. As a
 percentage of net sales, gross margin improved to approximately 26% in the
 second quarter of 1999 as compared to the second quarter 1998 gross margin of
 negative 9% and 1998 adjusted gross margin of approximately 14%. The three
 operating groups contributed nearly equally to the margin improvements in the
 1999 period. Approximately half of the Outdoor Leisure group's margin
 improvement resulted from additional volume and an improved product mix with the
 remaining improvement resulting from favorable overhead absorption as a result
 of higher manufacturing volumes. The improvement in the Household group was
 driven by appliances and personal care products which benefited from improved
 manufacturing efficiencies and cost benefits achieved from sourcing additional
 finished goods from third party vendors. Approximately 70% of the improvement in
 the International group's gross margin resulted from the benefit of the shut
 down of the Mexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced high
 material usage costs and employee benefit costs in the second quarter a year
 ago. The remaining improvement in the International group resulted from gross
 margin generated by higher sales volumes and a lower level of product returns.
 
          SG&A expense in the second quarter of 1999 was $156.8 million,
 representing an 11.4% increase over the same period in the prior year. Excluding
 the effect of Year 2000 compliance efforts ($5.4 million) recorded in the second
 quarter of 1999, SG&A expense increased approximately $11 million (approximately
 8%) in 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998. This increase is largely
 attributable to higher levels of selling and administrative costs primarily in
 the Outdoor Leisure and International segments driven by increased net sales. In
 addition, SG&A expense in the second quarter of 1999 reflects costs associated
 with certain redundant operations resulting from the Company's 1998 acquisitions
 and the decision to bring in-house certain operating activities that are
 currently outsourced. The Company is in the process of fully integrating certain
 of these functions and expects that when this process has been completed
 consolidated SG&A expense for these functions will be reduced.
 
          Consolidated operating results for the second quarters of 1999 and
 1998, were a profit of $13.5 million in 1999 and a loss of $193.3 million in
 1998. Operating results for the second quarter of 1998, as adjusted, were a loss
 of $59.2 million. This change resulted from the factors discussed above.
 
          Interest expense in the second quarter of 1999 was $45.0 million as
 compared to $42.4 million in the same period in the prior year. Approximately
 half of this increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowings during the
 second quarter of 1999. The increased level of borrowings was attributable to
 capital expenditures since the second quarter of 1998. The balance of the
 increase was driven by the impact of higher interest rates during the 1999
 period and the amortization of the loan commitment fee (approximately $1
 million) the Company is obligated to pay under the terms of the New Credit
 Facility. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a
 discussion of the loan commitment fee.
 
          Other expense, net of $1.1 million for the second quarter of 1999
 included approximately $2 million relating to the bank credit facility and the
 debentures. The increased credit facility expenses primarily related to unused
 facility fees and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable to
 debenture holders. (See Note 3 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 Other expense, net of $2.1 million for the second quarter of 1998 primarily
 represents foreign exchange losses principally at the Company's operations in
 Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Other expense for this period also includes
 approximately $0.5 million related to unused facility fees. Expenses during the
 second quarter of 1999 and 1998 were partially offset by interest income of $1.1
 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
 
          The minority interest reported for the second quarter of 1999 and 1998
 relates to the minority interest held in Coleman by minority shareholders.
 
          Approximately $6 million of the $7.3 million income tax expense
 recorded in the second quarter of 1999 related to a U.S. tax liability generated
 by Coleman as a separate U.S. tax filing entity. As discussed below, in July
 1999, the Company acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permit
 it and Coleman to file consolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all future
 periods. The remaining tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 1999
 related to taxes on foreign income. Tax expense recorded for the second quarter
 of 1998 was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit was recorded
 on the Company's losses in either year as it is management's assessment that the
 Company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that deferred tax
 assets resulting from these losses would be realized through future taxable
 income.
 
          On July 12, 1999, the Company acquired 3,000,000 shares of a newly
 created series of Coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price
 of approximately $31 million. These shares, together with the shares of Coleman
 common stock the Company owns, enable Sunbeam to exercise 80.01% of the total
 voting power of Coleman's outstanding capital stock as of July 12, 1999. This
 class of preferred stock was created by Coleman and acquired by the Company in
 order to
 
                                        23
 <PAGE>
 enable Coleman and the Company to file consolidated federal income tax
 returns, and in certain jurisdictions, consolidated state income tax returns,
 prior to the consummation of the Coleman merger. In connection with the issuance
 of the shares of preferred stock, the Company entered into a tax sharing
 agreement with Coleman, pursuant to which Coleman will pay to Sunbeam amounts
 equal to the federal and state income taxes that would have been payable by
 Coleman had Coleman not been included in the consolidated income tax return of
 the Company. The net proceeds from the issuance of the shares by Coleman of its
 voting preferred stock to Coleman Worldwide were used by Coleman to make a
 partial repayment of loans outstanding from Sunbeam under the Intercompany Note.
 (See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
          As a result of repayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman
 acquisition, the Company recognized an extraordinary charge in the second
 quarter of 1998. The debt assumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition was
 repaid as a result of the requirements under the terms of the New Credit
 Facility. This extraordinary charge consisted of redemption premiums ($99.1
 million), unamortized debt discount ($13.8 million) and unamortized deferred
 financing costs ($0.9 million) and was net of income taxes ($10.7 million). (See
 Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1999 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998
 
          Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 were $1,184.9
 million and $826.1 million respectively, an increase of $358.8 million. Results
 for the six months ended June 30, 1998 include Coleman, Signature Brands and
 First Alert from their respective acquisition dates. After adjusting 1998 sales
 to include sales of the acquired companies for the periods from the beginning of
 1998 through the respective dates of acquisition, combined historical net sales
 would be $1,127.9 million. 1999 net sales increased approximately $57 million or
 approximately 5% over 1998 combined historical net sales. Information that
 adjusts for the results of the acquisitions prior to the actual acquisition
 dates (the "combined historical" information) is provided for informational
 purposes only and is to enhance comparability of the period presented. This
 information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined results would
 have been had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods
 presented. The increase in net sales is driven by the Outdoor Leisure group
 which had an increase of approximately $59 million in 1999 as compared to the
 combined historical net sales in the same period in the prior year. This
 increase over combined historical net sales was largely due to sales of outdoor
 recreation products and Powermate/registered trademark/ generators. The higher
 level of sales of these products is believed to be partially attributable to
 heightened consumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. The
 Company believes that this heightened sensitivity is reflective of a combination
 of factors, including weather conditions and Year 2000 considerations. Household
 net sales in 1999 decreased approximately $7 million compared to 1998 combined
 historical net sales. The Company believes that the channel loading that took
 place in the first quarter of 1998 was primarily responsible for this decrease.
 International net sales in 1999 increased $5.0 million over 1998 combined
 historical net sales. Higher sales in Canada and Europe resulted predominantly
 from strong retail demand of Powermate/registered trademark/ and outdoor
 recreation products. This increase was partially offset by the impact of weak
 economic conditions in Latin America.
 
          Gross margin for the first half of 1999 was $293.5 million or $312.2
 million higher than the comparable period in 1998. Adjusting for the combined
 results of the acquired companies and excluding the effects of 1998
 non-recurring adjustments, which are summarized above under the heading "1998
 Charges", gross margin for the first half of 1999 increased approximately $103
 million over the 1998 combined historical gross margin, with each of the
 operating groups contributing to the margin improvement. As a percentage of net
 sales, gross margin improved to approximately 25% in the first half of 1999 as
 compared to a negative 2% in the first half of 1998. The gross margin percentage
 for the 1998 period adjusted for the non-recurring charges and for the effect of
 the acquired companies was approximately 17% of combined historical net sales.
 The Household group contributed approximately $42 million of the 1999 gross
 margin improvement over the 1998 combined historical gross margin. The
 improvement in the Household group's gross margin resulted primarily from
 improved manufacturing processes and controls and reduced sales returns and
 allowances. The Outdoor Leisure group's gross margin in 1999 improved by
 approximately $41 million over 1998 combined historical gross margin.
 Approximately 70% of the improvement in the Outdoor Leisure group's gross margin
 resulted from additional volume and improved mix. The remaining improvement
 resulted from improved manufacturing overhead absorption. The International
 group contributed approximately $20 million of the 1999 gross margin improvement
 over 1998 combined historical gross margin. Approximately 75% of the improvement
 in the International group's gross margin resulted from the shut down of the
 Mexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced high material usage
 costs and employee benefit costs in the prior year. The remaining improvement
 resulted from a lower level of product returns.
 
          SG&A expense for the first six months of 1999 was $294.8 million, an
 increase of $82.9 million or 39.1% over the same period in the prior year. After
 adjusting 1998 SG&A expense to include the acquired companies' SG&A expense
 
                                        24
 <PAGE>
 for the period from the beginning of 1998 through the respective dates of
 acquisition ($101.0 million), combined historical SG&A expense was $312.9
 million. Since the combined historical 1998 SG&A expenses were derived by adding
 the acquired companies' pre-acquisition period costs to the reported six months'
 results of Sunbeam, the combined historical SG&A expenses include $19.0 million
 of amortization of intangibles expense representing both pre- and
 post-acquisition periods, as well as approximately $12 million of transaction
 costs incurred by the acquired companies relating the them being purchased by
 Sunbeam. Excluding these costs, and the 1998 non-recurring charges of $30.7
 million, as described above under "1998 Charges", adjusted 1998 SG&A expenses
 were approximately $251 million. The 1999 SG&A expenses included $27.1 million
 of amortization of intangibles expense and $13.5 million of costs for Year 2000
 compliance efforts. Excluding these costs, the adjusted 1999 SG&A costs were
 $254.2 million, nearly flat with a year ago.
 
          Operating results for the first halves of 1999 and 1998, were a loss of
 $1.3 million in 1999 and a loss of $230.6 million in 1998. Adjusted for the
 historical results of the acquired companies and excluding 1998 non-recurring
 charges, as previously described, operating results for the 1999 and 1998
 periods were losses of $1.3 million and $91.8 million, respectively. This change
 resulted from the factors discussed above.
 
          Interest expense increased from $47.5 million in the first half of 1998
 to $87.0 million in the first half of 1999. Nearly all of the change related to
 higher borrowing levels in 1999 resulting primarily from borrowings for the
 acquisitions that were outstanding for the entire 1999 six month period as
 compared to only a portion of the 1998 period.
 
          Other expense, net of $1.9 million for the first half of 1999 included
 approximately $4 million relating to the bank credit facility and the
 debentures. The credit facility expenses primarily related to unused facility
 fees and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable to
 debenture holders. (See Note 3 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 Other expense, net of $5.3 million for the first half of 1998 primarily
 represented foreign exchange losses principally at the Company's operations in
 Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Other expense for this period also includes
 approximately $1.0 million relating to an unused facility fee. Expenses during
 both periods were partially offset by interest income of $1.7 million.
 
          The minority interest reported in 1999 and 1998 relates to the minority
 interest held in Coleman by minority shareholders.
 
          Approximately $6 million of the $9.0 million income tax expense
 recorded in 1999 related to a U.S. tax liability generated by Coleman as a
 separate U.S. tax filing entity. As previously discussed, in July 1999, the
 Company acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permit it to file
 consolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all future periods. The remaining
 tax expense recorded in 1999 related to taxes on foreign income. Tax expense
 recorded in 1998 was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit was
 recorded on the Company's losses in either year as it is management's assessment
 that the Company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that
 deferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through future
 taxable income.
 
          In March 1998, the Company prepaid a $75.0 million 7.85% industrial
 revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in 2009. In
 connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized an
 extraordinary charge in the first quarter of 1998. As a result of repayment of
 certain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, the Company also
 recognized and extraordinary charge in the second quarter of 1998. The debt
 assumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of the
 requirements under the terms of the New Credit Facility. These extraordinary
 charges consisted of redemption premiums ($106.9 million), unamortized debt
 discount ($13.8 million) and unamortized deferred financing costs ($1.7 million)
 and were net of income taxes ($10.7 million).
 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
          Approximately 75% of the Company's business is conducted in U.S.
  dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,
  primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of
  European sales). The Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made
  principally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.
  Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997;
  therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets were
  included as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not considered
  hyperinflationary as of January 1, 1999. This change in Mexico's
  hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the
  Company's financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from the
  Company's non-U.S. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on
  the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
                                        25
 <PAGE>
          While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not been
 significant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative
 effect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in Latin
 America have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales in
 and exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as the
 economic environments in those regions remain unsettled.
 
          On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures that
 arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered into
 for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had a
 material impact on the Company's financial results.
 
 SEASONALITY
 
          Sunbeam's consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial
 seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the second
 quarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,
 including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alert
 products, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weather
 conditions.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 DEBT INSTRUMENTS
 
          In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert and
 Signature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the
 Company and the three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering in
 March 1998 of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of 5%
 (approximately $2,014 million principal amount at maturity), which resulted in
 approximately $730 million of net proceeds and borrowed about $1,325 million
 under its new bank credit facility.
 
          The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company's common
 stock at an initial conversion rate of 6.575 shares for each $1,000 principal
 amount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence of
 specified events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all
 existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are not
 redeemable by the Company prior to March 25, 2003. On or after such date, the
 debentures are redeemable for cash with at least 30 days notice, at the option
 of the Company. The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option of
 the holder as of March 25, 2003, March 25, 2008 and March 25, 2013, at purchase
 prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.
 Sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or
 common stock or any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facility
 prohibits the Company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. The
 Company was required to file a registration statement with the SEC to register
 the debentures by June 23, 1998. This registration statement was filed on
 February 4, 1999 and the SEC has not declared the registration statement
 effective. The Company's failure to file the registration statement by June 23,
 1998 did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. As part of
 the normal review process by the SEC, a number of comments have been made by the
 staff of the Division of Corporation Finance relating to the registration
 statement and the restated 1996 and 1997 financial statements included therein.
 The Company has filed amendments to this registration statement. From June 23,
 1998 until the registration statement is declared effective, the Company is
 required to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, for
 each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% during the first
 90 days and 0.50% thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the
 debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Company
 made its first payment of approximately $500,000 to the debenture holders on
 September 25, 1998 and an additional $2 million was paid on March 25, 1999. An
 additional cash payment of approximately $2 million, representing the Company's
 liability to debenture holders through June 30, 1999, was paid on September 25,
 1999.
 
          Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its $250 million
 syndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank credit
 facility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to
 $1.7 billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the Company
 to maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge
 coverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March 31,
 1998 and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of the
 borrowings under the bank credit facility.
 
          As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurred
 during the first half of 1998, the Company did not achieve the specified
 financial ratios for June 30, 1998 and it appeared unlikely that the Company
 would achieve the specified financial ratios for September 30, 1998.
 Consequently, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement
 
                                        26
 <PAGE>
 dated as of June 30, 1998 that waived through December 31, 1998 all defaults
 arising from the failure of the Company to satisfy the specified financial
 ratios for June 30, 1998 and September 30, 1998. Pursuant to an agreement with
 the Company dated as of October 19, 1998, the Company's lenders extended all of
 the waivers under the June 30 agreement through April 10, 1999 and also waived
 through such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to
 satisfy the specified financial ratios for December 31, 1998. As part of the
 October 19, 1998 agreement, the Company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings
 before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") covenant (as
 defined in the bank credit facility) which covenant the Company had been able to
 satisfy.
 
          On April 10, 1999, among other things, the lenders extended all of the
 waivers set forth in the October 19, 1998 agreement through April 15, 1999. On
 April 15, 1999, the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensive
 amendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all of
 the waivers under the April 10, 1999 agreement until April 10, 2000 and waived
 until such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy
 the specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during 1999
 and for March 31, 2000. Following is a description of the significant terms of
 the bank credit facility as amended April 15, 1999. As part of the April 15,
 1999 bank credit facility amendment, the Company agreed to a minimum cumulative
 EBITDA covenant that is based on post-December 31, 1998 consolidated EBITDA and
 is tested at the end of each month occurring on or prior to March 31, 2000, as
 well as a covenant limiting the amount of revolving loans (other than those used
 to fund the Coleman merger) that may be outstanding under the bank credit
 facility as of the end of each such month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA was
 initially $6.3 million for the period January 1, 1999 through April 30, 1999 and
 generally grows on a monthly basis until it reaches $121.0 million for the
 period from January 1, 1999 through March 31, 2000.
 
 The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $1.7 billion
 through:
 
      o        a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up
               to $400.0 million maturing March 30, 2005, $52.5 million of which
               may only be used to complete the Coleman;
 
      o        up to $800.0 million in term loans maturing on March 30, 2005, of
               which $35.0 million may only be used to complete the Coleman
               merger; and
 
      o        a $500.0 million term loan maturing September 30, 2006, of which
               $5.0 million has already been repaid through June 30, 1999.
 
          As of June 30, 1999, approximately $1.4 billion was outstanding and
 approximately $0.2 billion was available for borrowing under the bank credit
 facility. The remaining $0.1 billion of the $1.7 billion bank credit facility
 was committed for outstanding letters of credit.
 
 Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the Company's option:
 
      o        at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR");
 
      o        or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally
               the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the
               administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%;
 
 in each case plus an interest margin which is currently 4.00% for LIBOR loans
 and 2.50% for base rate loans. The interest margin is subject to potential
 decreases in the future, including a decrease to 3.00% for LIBOR loans and 1.75%
 for base rate loans upon consummation of the Coleman merger and the
 effectiveness of the pledge of substantially all of Coleman's and its domestic
 subsidiaries' assets to secure the obligations under the bank credit facility.
 
          Under the terms of the April 15, 1999 amendment to the bank credit
 facility, the Company is obligated to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment fee
 of between 0.25% to 1.00% of the commitments under the bank credit facility as
 of April 15, 1999. The percentage used to calculate the fee will be determined
 by reference to the bank lenders' aggregate commmitments and loan exposure under
 the bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before September 30, 2000.
 The fee is payable on the earlier of September 30, 2000 and the date the
 commitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bank
 credit facility are repaid. (See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
          Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge of
 the stock of the Company's material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by a
 security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
 material domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiaries
 except as described below. Currently, Coleman's inventory and related assets are
 pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account
 
                                        27
 <PAGE>
 under the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman's note
 payable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic
 assets, other than real property, including 66% of the stock of its direct
 foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiaries
 and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not the
 assets of Coleman's subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company's
 lending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as security for the
 Company's obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,
 substantially all of Coleman's assets and the assets of Coleman's domestic
 subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank credit
 facility.
 
          In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteed
 by a number of the Company's wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and
 these subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion of
 the Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries will
 become guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To the
 extent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, the
 obligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company.
 
          In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bank
 credit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similar
 nature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and its
 subsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things:
 
      o        declare dividends or repurchase stock;
 
      o        prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in
               sale-leaseback transactions;
      o        make loans and investments;
      o        incur additional debt (including revolving loans under the bank
               credit facility);
      o        amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into
               restrictive agreements;
      o        make capital and Year 2000 compliance expenditures;
      o        engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;
      o        engage in certain transactions with specified affiliates;
      o        settle certain litigation;
      o        alter its cash management system; and
      o        alter the businesses they conduct.
 
 Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants and
 ratios.
 
 The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary for
 transactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of
 covenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising from
 compliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees and
 change of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bank
 credit facility if the Company's registration statement in connection with the
 Coleman merger is not declared effective by the SEC on or before October 30,
 1999 (effective as of October 25, 1999, the bank lenders agreed to extend this
 date to November 30, 1999), or if the merger does not occur within 25 business
 days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash
 consideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of any
 appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customary
 fees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds $87.5 million.
 Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfy
 these conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company to
 prepay term loans under the bank credit facility on each of September 30, 1999
 and December 31, 1999 to the extent that cash on hand in the Company's
 concentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loan
 commitments on these dates (excluding, for the September measurement date, $52.5
 million reserved for the Coleman merger), exceeds $115 million and $125 million,
 respectively, but the Company is not required to prepay more than $69.3 million
 in the aggregate as a result of the provision.
 
          Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company to
 satisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank credit
 facility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank credit
 facility would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a 2.00% increase in the
 interest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter of
 credit fees to 1.00% and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstanding
 borrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their other
 rights and remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights and
 remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
          The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral of
 the 1999 scheduled term loan payments of $69.3 million until April 10, 2000 as a
 result of the satisfaction by the Company on May 14, 1999 of the agreed upon
 conditions to the deferral. (See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
                                        28

 CASH FLOWS
 
          As of June 30, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $51.1
 million and total debt of $2.3 billion. Because the waivers granted by the
 Company's lenders expire on April 10, 2000, the borrowings under the bank credit
 facility, as well as other debt containing cross-default provisions, are
 classified as short-term in the June 30, 1999 Condensed Consolidated Balance
 Sheet. Cash used in operating activities during the first half of 1999 was $34.5
 million compared to $217.6 million in the first half of 1998. This change is
 primarily attributable to working capital improvements and improved operating
 results. The majority of the working capital improvements are attributable to
 the Company's management of inventory levels. Inventories generated
 approximately $78 million of additional cash flow versus the same period in the
 prior year. The inventory change in the 1998 period reflects inventory changes
 of the acquired companies from their respective dates of acquisition. Increases
 in accounts payable generated approximately $41 million of cash in the first six
 months of 1999 whereas payables used approximately $25 million of cash in the
 same period of 1998, resulting in an improvement in cash flow period-to-period
 of approximately $66 million. The increase in payables in the current period
 resulted from payables balances having been reduced to a low level by year-end
 1998. This reduction in payables, which included an effort to reduce delinquent
 payables, began in the second quarter of 1998. These cash flow improvements are
 partially offset by increases in accounts receivable. The increase in
 receivables during the first half of 1999 is largely due to the seasonal selling
 period of the Company's Outdoor Leisure division which experienced a stronger
 second quarter in 1999 than in 1998. The Company participates in an accounts
 receivable securitization program to finance a portion of its accounts
 receivable. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
          In the first half of 1999, cash used in investing activities was driven
 by capital expenditures of $33.6 million, primarily for information systems,
 including expenditures for Year 2000 readiness and equipment and tooling for new
 products. Capital spending in the comparable 1998 period was $21.2 million and
 was primarily for several manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment and
 tooling for new products and management information systems and software
 licenses. The new product capital spending in the 1998 period principally
 related to the appliance category and included costs related to water and air
 filtration products which were discontinued in the second quarter, blenders,
 standmixers and irons. Cash used in investing activities in the first half of
 1998 also reflects $379.2 million for the acquisitions of the shares of Coleman
 from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, as well as the acquisitions of
 Signature Brands and First Alert. The Company anticipates 1999 capital spending
 to be less than 5% of net sales. Capital expenditures in the current year are
 expected to primarily relate to information systems and related support,
 including expenditures for Year 2000 readiness, new product introductions and
 capacity additions.
 
          Cash provided by financing activities totaled $58.0 million in the
 first half of 1999 and reflected net borrowings under the Company's bank credit
 facility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first half of 1998 was
 $608.6 million and reflected net proceeds from the debentures of $729.6 million,
 the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company's
 $250 million September 1996 revolving credit facility, the repayment of certain
 debt assumed in connection with the Coleman, Signature Brands and First Alert
 acquisitions, and the early extinguishment of the $75.0 million Hattiesburg
 bond. In addition, cash provided by financing activities in 1998 is net of $25.1
 million of financing fees related to Sunbeam's $1.7 billion bank credit facility
 and $19.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. (See Note 3
 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
          At June 30, 1999, standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated
 $67.9 million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental,
 workers' compensation, and international trade activities. In addition, as of
 June 30, 1999, surety bonds with a contract value of $66.5 million were
 outstanding largely for the Company's pension plans and as a result of
 litigation judgments that are currently under appeal. For additional information
 relating to the debentures, the bank credit facility and the repayment of debt,
 see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
          The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman
 in a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority shareholders will
 receive 0.5677 of a share of the Company's common stock and $6.44 in cash for
 each share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition, unexercised options
 under Coleman's stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equal
 to the difference between $27.50 and the exercise price of such options. The
 Company expects to issue approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and
 expend approximately $87 million in cash, including cash paid to option holders,
 to complete the Coleman transaction. Under a proposed settlement of certain
 litigation relating to the Coleman merger, the Company will also issue warrants
 to purchase up to 4.98 million shares of the Company's common stock to the
 Coleman public stockholders and the plaintiff's litigation counsel upon
 consummation of the Coleman merger. (See Notes 2 and 10 to the Condensed
 Consolidated Financial Statements.) Although there can be no assurance, it is
 anticipated that the Coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal
 1999.
 
                                        29
 <PAGE>
          The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank credit
 facility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquired
 companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable
 securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,
 capital expenditure and Year 2000 compliance spending, and debt service through
 April 10, 2000. The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an
 amendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on further
 waiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility.
 Any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be
 made based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particular
 transactions. There can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of
 existing covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April
 10, 2000. The failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt
 refinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants and
 compliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate
 the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility, which
 would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. Accordingly, debt
 related to the bank credit facility and all debt containing cross-default
 provisions is classified as current in the balance sheet at June 30, 1999.
 
          In May, 1998, the NYSE advised the Company that it did not meet the
 continuing listing standards of the NYSE because the Company did not have
 tangible net assets of at least $12 million and average annual net income of at
 least $600,000 for 1995, 1996 and 1997. Representatives from the Company met
 with NYSE officials, and in March 1999, the NYSE informed the Company that the
 Company's common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the NYSE
 would, however, continue to monitor Sunbeam's financial condition and
 operations. On August 5, 1999, the NYSE advised the Company that the NYSE had
 revised its continuing listing standards, and that the Company is in compliance
 with the revised standards.
 
          In April, 1999 the NYSE advised Coleman that it did not meet the NYSE's
 continuing listing standards because Coleman did not have tangible net assets of
 at least $12 million as of September 30, 1998 and average annual net income of
 at least $600,000 for 1995, 1996 and 1997. At that time, Coleman requested the
 NYSE to continue to list the Coleman common stock until completion of the
 merger. The NYSE subsequently advised Coleman that Coleman also failed to
 satisfy certain non-financial continuing listing standards. On August 5, 1999,
 the NYSE advised the Coleman that the NYSE had revised its continuing listing
 standards, and that Coleman is in compliance with the revised financial
 standards. Coleman and the NYSE have agreed upon a program whereby Coleman will
 correct the deficiencies in its non-financial continuing listing standards by
 the end of 1999. Coleman is currently complying with such program. If Coleman
 were to be delisted from the NYSE, it would adversely affect Coleman's ability
 to sell its capital stock to third parties or use its capital stock as
 collateral for loans. Sunbeam's bank credit facility currently restricts Coleman
 from taking such actions.
 
          By letter dated June 17, 1998, the staff of the Division of Enforcement
 of the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry into
 the Company's accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Company
 produce documents. On July 2, 1998, the SEC issued a Formal Order of Private
 Investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which a
 subpoena was served on Sunbeam requiring the production of documents. On
 November 4, 1998, the Company received another SEC subpoena requiring the
 production of additional documents. The Company has provided numerous documents
 to the SEC staff and continues to cooperate with the SEC staff. The Company has,
 however declined to provide the SEC with material that the Company believes is
 subject to the attorney-client privilege and the work product immunity. The
 Company cannot predict the term of such investigation or its potential outcome.
 
          The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class and
 derivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of its
 consolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbes
 warrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of Messrs.
 Dunlap and Kersh. Sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, but
 cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihood
 of the Company's success in each case or the range of potential loss. However,
 if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a material
 adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations and
 cash flows. Additionally, the Company's insurance carriers have filed various
 suits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors' and officers'
 liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid and/or had been
 properly canceled by the carriers or have advised Sunbeam of their intent to
 deny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue recovery from
 all of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or its
 indemnified officers and/or directors under any of the foregoing actions and to
 recover attorneys' fees covered under those policies. The Company's failure to
 obtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against the
 Company on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on
 the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
          Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs
 (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation and
 claims and related anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is both
 probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
 the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the
 Company's assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on
 the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature
 of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and
 
                                        30
 <PAGE>
 any relevant information about the plaintiff, and other significant factors
 which vary by case. When it is not possible to estimate a specific expected
 amount of loss to be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of possible
 losses and records the minimum end of the range. As of June 30, 1999 the Company
 had established accruals for litigation matters of $28.7 million (representing
 $12.5 million and $16.2 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and
 legal fees, respectively) and $31.2 million as of December 31, 1998
 (representing $17.5 million and $13.7 million for estimated damages or
 settlements and legal fees, respectively.) It is anticipated that the $28.7
 million accrual will be paid as follows: $16.3 million in 1999, $10.3 million in
 2000 and $2.1 million in 2001. The Company believes, based on facts known to the
 Company at June 30, 1999, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters
 existing as of June 30, 1999 have been adequately reserved to the extent
 determinable.
 
          As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the
 constant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for
 substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated
 rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could result
 in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the product
 lines the Company acquired in the 1998 acquisitions have increased its exposure
 to product liability and related claims.
 
          The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuits
 from time to time that Sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigation
 incidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution of
 these routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individually
 or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
 position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
 
          See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
          Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position
 98-1, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR
 INTERNAL USE ("SOP 98-1"). SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated
 with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain
 capitalization criteria are met. Adoption of this statement did not have a
 material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
 operations, or cash flows.
 
          In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
 of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), ACCOUNTING FOR
 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which, as amended, is effective
 for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires the
 recognition of all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either
 assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company has not yet determined
 the impact SFAS No. 133 will have on its consolidated financial position,
 results of operations, or cash flows.
 
 YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
 
          The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year 2000 on its
 operations. Year 2000 issues could include potential problems in the information
 technology ("IT") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations and
 problems in the Company's products. Year 2000 system failures could affect
 routine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,
 order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. In
 addition, system failures could affect the Company's security, payroll
 operations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potential
 risks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequately
 address their own Year 2000 issues.
 
 SUNBEAM'S APPROACH TO YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
          While the Company's Year 2000 readiness planning has been underway for
 over one year, during the third quarter of 1998 the Company established a
 cross-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by three
 external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and
 to assist the Company in implementing its Year 2000 strategy. This team is
 sponsored by the Company's Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to the
 Company's Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of the
 Board of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company's Year
 2000 readiness program.
 
                                        31
 <PAGE>
          The Year 2000 project team has developed a phased approach to identify
 and resolve Year 2000 issues with many of these activities conducted in
 parallel. The Company's approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are
 described below.
 
          PHASE 1 - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam's
 Year 2000 readiness program, the Company established a Year 2000 Program
 Management Office ("PMO") to centralize the management of all of the Company's
 Year 2000 projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,
 uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year 2000 issues.
 
          The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software
 systems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,
 telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year 2000
 problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,
 ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into the
 Company's Year 2000 database along with a determination of the item's level of
 criticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have a
 significant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company's Year 2000
 program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. All
 information relative to each item is being tracked in the Company's Year 2000
 database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth
 quarters of 1998. The Company has completed a review of the readiness of
 embedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the
 Company's products have Year 2000 date sensitive systems.
 
          PHASE 2 - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam's Year
 2000 readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (as
 necessary) those items identified during Phase 1 as requiring corrective action.
 
          Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that are
 critical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted by
 not being ready for any Year 2000 issues include, among others, purchases of
 materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, payroll
 processing and billings and collections. Systems and applications that have been
 identified by Sunbeam to date as not currently Year 2000 ready and which are
 critical to Sunbeam's operations include its financial software systems, which
 process the order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger,
 accounts receivable, and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and
 critical applications in the Company's manufacturing and distribution
 facilities, such as warehouse management applications. Recognizing how dependent
 the entire company is on IT, Sunbeam decided in 1997 to replace its primary
 business applications with a uniform international business and accounting
 information system to address the systems or applications listed above as well
 as to improve internal reporting processes. Based upon representations from the
 manufacturer that the current version of this uniform information system is Year
 2000 ready, the Company has been actively upgrading its business sites that
 currently utilize this uniform system to the Year 2000 ready version. In
 addition to the pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations which had already utilized an
 earlier non-Year 2000 ready version of this uniform business and accounting
 information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee, Health-o-Meter and Sunbeam Latin
 America are replacing their current non-Year 2000 ready systems with this new
 uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe is also replacing key business
 components with this new system.
 
          The Company is also actively replacing and/or upgrading a number of
 business systems that are not Year 2000 ready, including those that use
 localized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by
 the uniform business and accounting information system. For example, at Coleman
 approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs that are used in lieu of
 Sunbeam's uniform business and accounting information system have been
 remediated and tested to be Year 2000 ready. With respect to the Company's
 non-IT systems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-line
 manufacturing hardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items to assess
 any Year 2000 issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and the
 Company will continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items.
 
          Sunbeam has largely implemented the corrective work described above and
 expects to complete final testing and implementation of such systems in the
 third quarter and early fourth quarter of 1999.
 
          PHASE 3 - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phase
 of Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program which was initiated during the third
 and fourth quarters of 1998 is designed to assess and interact with the
 Company's customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,
 the Company surveyed 1,100 vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did not
 provide an initial response. During the first half of 1999, "high risk" vendors
 were contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has since decreased
 substantially. In fact, currently only 7% of the Company's vendors who were
 surveyed are categorized as "high risk" which includes non-respondents. Based on
 the most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the Company
 believes that there is only a low to a medium risk of Year 2000 issues for the
 remaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor the Year 2000 progress
 of the
 
                                        32
 <PAGE>
 "high risk" vendors and has re-surveyed these companies to determine the
 appropriate course of action. Furthermore, the Company is in the process of
 contacting alternate vendors who are Year 2000 ready to replace critical vendors
 deemed "high risk" in the event that these vendors are not found to be Year 2000
 ready. The Company is in the process of completing a verification of the Year
 2000 survey responses for the most critical vendors to the Company.
 
           Sunbeam has responded to numerous customer inquiries about the
 Company's Year 2000 readiness. The Company has verified that all of the
 Company's major customers have planned programs to deal with Year 2000 issues
 and is currently completing the process of contacting its major customers to
 confirm they are implementing their planned programs to address Year 2000
 issues. In order to improve the Company's communication with its customers,
 suppliers and business partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year 2000
 telephone number and is providing Year 2000 information on a Company web site.
 
          PHASE 4 - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingency
 planning for unresolved Year 2000 issues, particularly any issues arising with
 third party suppliers. The Company's Year 2000 readiness program is ongoing and
 its ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, will
 continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. The Company has
 designed its Year 2000 contingency plan and is in the process of implementing
 it. The development of the contingency plan included a process whereby the
 Company's critical IT and non-IT systems were evaluated for Year 2000 readiness.
 As a result of this evaluation, the Company does not expect to require
 additional operational equipment or significant process contingency measures.
 Although the Company does not currently believe there is significant risk
 associated with its third party suppliers, the contingency plan includes the
 continuing evaluation of the readiness of the Company's suppliers and
 consideration of the Company's inventory requirements to protect against supply
 disruption. This evaluation process may result in an increase in inventory
 during the later months of 1999.
 
 THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM'S YEAR 2000 APPROACH
 
          The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year 2000
 readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company's approach, have
 assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest
 single component (upgrade or installation of the Company's uniform system) of
 the Company's Year 2000 program. Since Sunbeam's Year 2000 program was developed
 and is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company did not
 engage another independent third party to verify the program's overall approach
 or total cost as the Company believes that the Company's exposure in this regard
 is mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnostic
 software packages that are designed to analyze the Year 2000 readiness of
 business software programs, the Company was able to identify potential Year 2000
 issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it has also mitigated
 its risk by validating and verifying key program components.
 
          Management believes that, although there are significant systems that
 are being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accounting
 information system, Sunbeam's information systems environment will be made Year
 2000 ready prior to January 1, 2000. Sunbeam's failure to timely complete such
 corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 
          With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failure
 of certain of these third parties to become Year 2000 ready could also have a
 material adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of the
 Company's principal suppliers to have Year 2000 ready internal systems could
 impact the Company's ability to manufacture and/or ship its products or to
 maintain adequate inventory levels for production.
 
          At this time, the Company believes that the most likely "worst-case"
 scenario relating to Year 2000 involves potential disruptions in areas in which
 the Company's operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whose
 systems may not work properly after January 1, 2000. While such system failures
 could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Company
 and its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at present
 estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subject
 to the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third parties
 whose operations are not made ready for Year 2000 issues, the impact on
 Sunbeam's operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannot
 be developed prior to January 1, 2000.
 
          The nature and focus of the Company's efforts to address the Year 2000
 problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues
 are identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of the
 Company's efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections
 with respect to activities required in the future. These estimates and
 projections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may be
 substantial.

 <PAGE>
 THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY'S YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
          Through the first half of 1999, including costs incurred in 1998,
 Sunbeam had expended approximately $50 million to address Year 2000 issues of
 which approximately 45% was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainder
 as SG&A expense. Sunbeam's current assessment of the total costs to address and
 remedy Year 2000 issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs for
 the acquired companies, is approximately $60 million. This estimate includes the
 following categories:
 
  o   uniform international business and accounting systems         $  40 million
  o   localized business system software upgrades and remediation   $   9 million
  o   Year 2000 readiness assessment and tracking                   $   6 million
  o   upgrade of personal computers and related software            $   5 million
 
            The amount to be incurred for Year 2000 issues during 1999 of
 approximately $41 million represents over 50% of the Company's total 1999 budget
 for information systems and related support, including Year 2000 costs. A large
 majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that will
 not recur in the Year 2000 or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to third
 party consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well as the modification and
 replacement of software, represent approximately 75% of the total estimated
 cost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to software
 license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with Company
 employees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operating
 cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion of these
 expenditures will enhance Sunbeam's operating systems in addition to resolving
 the Year 2000 issues. As Sunbeam completes its assessment of the Year 2000
 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially
 from the amounts shown above. The bank credit facility does not permit the
 Company to spend more than $50 million on Year 2000 testing and remediation in
 1999.
 
          Because Year 2000 readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam has
 redeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year
 2000 issues, thereby deferring the non-critical systems enhancements. The
 Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a material
 impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash
 flows.
