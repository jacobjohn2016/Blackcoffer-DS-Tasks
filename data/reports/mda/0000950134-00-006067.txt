          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 1999
 
 SUMMARY AMR's income from continuing operations during the second quarter of
 2000 was $321 million, or $1.96 per common share diluted, as compared to $216
 million, or $1.36 per common share diluted, for the same period in 1999. AMR's
 operating income of $517 million increased $103 million compared to the same
 period in 1999. AMR's second quarter 2000 results include an approximate $36
 million after-tax gain, or $0.21 per common share diluted, related to the sale
 of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline.com
 Incorporated (priceline) common stock.
 
 The Company's REVENUES increased $470 million, or 10.4 percent, in the second
 quarter of 2000 versus the same period last year. American's PASSENGER REVENUES
 increased by 11.6 percent, or $435 million, compared to the second quarter of
 1999. American's YIELD (the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile)
 of 13.75 cents increased by 6.0 percent compared to the same period in 1999.
 Domestic yields increased 5.5 percent from the second quarter of 1999.
 International yields increased 7.2 percent, reflecting an increase of 12.3
 percent, 9.9 percent and 4.3 percent in Pacific, Europe and Latin American
 yields, respectively. The increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong
 U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel both domestically and
 internationally, and a favorable pricing climate.
 
 American's traffic or REVENUE PASSENGER MILES (RPMs) increased 5.3 percent to
 30.4 billion miles for the quarter ended June 30, 2000. American's capacity or
 AVAILABLE SEAT MILES (ASMs) decreased 0.8 percent to 40.1 billion miles in the
 second quarter of 2000. American's domestic traffic increased 4.2 percent on a
 capacity decrease of 2.7 percent and international traffic increased 7.7 percent
 on capacity increases of 3.5 percent. The decrease in domestic capacity was due
 primarily to the Company's "More Room Throughout Coach" initiative. The increase
 in international traffic was driven by a 10.1 percent increase in traffic to
 Europe on capacity growth of 6.4 percent, a 9.7 percent increase in traffic to
 the Pacific on a capacity increase of 0.8 percent and a 4.8 percent increase in
 traffic to Latin America on capacity growth of 1.8 percent.
 
 The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES increased 8.9 percent, or $367 million.
 American's cost per ASM increased 10.0 percent to 10.24 cents. WAGES, SALARIES
 AND BENEFITS increased 7.2 percent, or $113 million, primarily due to an
 increase in the average number of equivalent employees, contractual wage rate
 and seniority increases that are built into the Company's labor contracts and an
 increase in the provision for profit-sharing. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense increased
 37.0 percent, or $153 million, due to a 33.9 percent increase in the Company's
 average price per gallon and a 2.5 percent increase in the Company's fuel
 consumption. The increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $110
 million recognized during the second quarter of 2000 related to the Company's
 fuel hedging program. MAINTENANCE, MATERIALS AND REPAIRS increased $49 million,
 or 22.0 percent, due primarily to an increase in airframe and engine maintenance
 volumes at the Company's maintenance bases and an approximate $17 million
 one-time credit the Company received in the second quarter of 1999. COMMISSIONS
 TO AGENTS decreased 8.4 percent, or $25 million, despite an increase of
 approximately 11.3 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the benefit
 from the international base commission structure change implemented in October
 1999 and a decrease in commissionable transactions.
 
 INTEREST INCOME increased approximately $17 million due primarily to higher
 investment balances. INTEREST EXPENSE increased approximately $21 million, or
 22.3 percent, due to an increase in long-term debt. INTEREST CAPITALIZED
 increased 24.1 percent, or $7 million, due to an increase in purchase deposits
 for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS - NET increased approximately $56 million
 due primarily to the $57 million gain on sale of the Company's warrants to
 purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 1999
 
 SUMMARY AMR's income from continuing operations for the six months ended June
 30, 2000 was $410 million, or $2.58 per common share diluted. This compares with
 income from continuing operations of $233 million, or $1.45 per common share
 diluted, for the same period in 1999. AMR's operating income of $729 million
 increased 58.5 percent, or $269 million, compared to the same period in 1999.
 AMR's 2000 results from continuing operations include an approximate $36 million
 after-tax gain, or $0.22 per common share diluted, related to the sale of the
 Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock.
 AMR's 1999 results from continuing operations include a labor disagreement that
 disrupted the Company's operations and negatively impacted the Company's 1999
 net earnings by an estimated $140 million, or $0.87 per common share diluted,
 partially offset by an approximate $19 million after-tax gain, or $0.12 per
 common share diluted, related to the sale of a portion of American's holdings in
 Equant, N.V. (Equant).
 
 The Company's REVENUES increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 12.2 percent,
 during the first six months of 2000 versus the same period last year. American's
 PASSENGER REVENUES increased by 12.5 percent, or $885 million. American's YIELD
 of 13.84 cents increased by 6.1 percent compared to the same period in 1999.
 Domestic yields increased 5.8 percent from the first six months of 1999.
 International yields increased 7.1 percent, reflecting an increase of 16.9
 percent, 8.6 percent and 4.8 percent in Pacific, Europe and Latin American
 yields, respectively. The increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong
 U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel both domestically and
 internationally, and a favorable pricing climate. In addition, the first quarter
 of 1999 includes a schedule disruption which impacted the Company's operations.
 
 American's traffic or REVENUE PASSENGER MILES (RPMs) increased 6.0 percent to
 57.4 billion miles for the six months ended June 30, 2000. American's capacity
 or AVAILABLE SEAT MILES (ASMs) increased 2.6 percent to 80.1 billion miles in
 the first six months of 2000. American's domestic traffic increased 4.8 percent
 on capacity growth of 1.1 percent and international traffic increased 8.9
 percent on capacity increases of 6.0 percent. The increase in domestic capacity
 was due primarily to the addition of new aircraft, mostly offset by the
 Company's "More Room Throughout Coach" initiative. The increase in international
 traffic was driven by a 16.2 percent increase in traffic to the Pacific on
 capacity growth of 5.2 percent, an 11.0 percent increase in traffic to Europe on
 a capacity increase of 9.9 percent and a 5.6 percent increase in traffic to
 Latin America on capacity growth of 3.2 percent.
 
 AMR Eagle's passenger REVENUES increased 15.5 percent, or $95 million, due
 primarily to the acquisition of Business Express, Inc. in March 1999.
 
 Cargo REVENUES increased $38 million, or 12.3 percent, due primarily to a fuel
 surcharge implemented in February 2000 and the Company's increase in cargo
 capacity from the addition of new aircraft in late 1999 and 2000.
 
 The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES increased 9.5 percent, or $771 million.
 American's cost per ASM increased by 6.8 percent to 10.10 cents. WAGES, SALARIES
 AND BENEFITS increased $263 million, or 8.7 percent, primarily due to an
 increase in the average number of equivalent employees, contractual wage rate
 and seniority increases that are built into the Company's labor contracts and an
 increase in the provision for profit-sharing. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense increased
 46.8 percent, or $357 million, due to a 40.4 percent increase in the Company's
 average price per gallon and a 4.9 percent increase in the Company's fuel
 consumption. The increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $232
 million recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2000 related to the
 Company's fuel hedging program. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION expense increased
 $61 million, or 11.7 percent, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft.
 MAINTENANCE, MATERIALS AND REPAIRS expense increased 13.1 percent, or $63
 million, due primarily to an increase in airframe and engine maintenance volumes
 at the Company's maintenance bases and an approximate $17 million one-time
 credit the Company received in the second quarter of 1999. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS
 decreased 9.6 percent, or $56 million, despite an increase of approximately 12.8
 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the benefit from the
 international base commission structure change implemented in October 1999 and a
 decrease in commissionable transactions.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
 INTEREST INCOME increased approximately 61.0 percent, or $25 million, due
 primarily to higher investment balances. INTEREST EXPENSE increased
 approximately $47 million, or 25.1 percent, due to an increase in long-term
 debt. INTEREST CAPITALIZED increased 19.4 percent, or $12 million, due to an
 increase in purchase deposits for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS - NET
 increased approximately 83.3 percent, or $20 million, due primarily to the gain
 on sale of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline
 common stock in the second quarter of 2000, which resulted in a $57 million
 gain. In the first quarter of 1999, the Company recorded an approximate $31
 million gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in Equant.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES in the six-month period ended June 30,
 2000 was $1.8 billion, an increase of $693 million over the same period in 1999.
 This increase resulted primarily from an increase in the air traffic liability
 due to higher advanced sales and an increase in income from continuing
 operations. Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2000 were $1.9
 billion, and included the acquisition of 11 Boeing 777-200IGWs, 12 Boeing
 737-800s, 11 Embraer 135 aircraft and five Embraer 145 aircraft. These capital
 expenditures were financed with internally generated cash and the $559 million
 of cash received from the Sabre dividend, except for the Embraer aircraft
 acquisitions which were funded through secured debt agreements.
 
      As of June 30, 2000, the Company had commitments to acquire the following
 aircraft: 69 Boeing 737-800s, 20 Boeing 757-200s, 15 Boeing 777-200IGWs, 87
 Embraer regional jets and 25 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries of these aircraft
 extend through 2006. Payments for these aircraft will approximate $1.1 billion
 during the remainder of 2000, $2.3 billion in 2001, $650 million in 2002 and an
 aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006. The Company
 expects to fund its remaining 2000 capital expenditures from the Company's
 existing cash and short-term investments, internally generated cash, and new
 financing depending upon capital market conditions and the Company's evolving
 view of its long-term needs.
 
 OTHER INFORMATION
 
 DALLAS LOVE FIELD
 
 In 1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of Fort Worth and Dallas to
 build and operate Dallas/Fort Worth Airport (DFW), a bond ordinance was enacted
 by both cities (the Bond Ordinance). The Bond Ordinance required both cities to
 direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations to DFW and was an integral
 part of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of DFW. In 1979, as
 part of a settlement to resolve litigation with Southwest Airlines, the cities
 agreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the Bond Ordinance at
 Dallas' Love Field. Congress enacted the Wright Amendment to prevent the federal
 government from acting inconsistent with this agreement. The Wright Amendment
 limited interstate operations at Love Field to the four states contiguous to
 Texas (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) and prohibited through
 ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. In 1997, without the
 consent of either city, Congress amended the Wright Amendment by (i) adding
 three states (Kansas, Mississippi, and Alabama) to the perimeter and (ii)
 removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with 56 seats or
 less (the 1997 Amendment).
 
      In October 1997, the City of Fort Worth filed suit in state district court
 against the City of Dallas and others seeking to enforce the Bond Ordinance.
 Fort Worth contended that the 1997 Amendment does not preclude the City of
 Dallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic at Love Field
 in a manner consistent with the Bond Ordinance and, moreover, that Dallas has an
 obligation to do so. American joined in this litigation. On October 15, 1998,
 the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of American and Fort
 Worth. On May 25, 2000, the Fort Worth Court of Appeals overturned the district
 court order and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted by federal law.
 American and Fort Worth filed motions asking the Fort Worth Court of Appeals to
 reconsider its decision. In the same lawsuit, DFW filed claims alleging that
 irrespective of whether the Bond Ordinance was enforceable, the DFW Use
 Agreement prohibited American and other DFW signatory airlines from moving any
 interstate operations to Love Field.
 
      Dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the United States
 District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking to
 have the court declare that, as a matter of law, the 1997 Amendment precludes
 the City of Dallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at Love Field.
 Further, in May 1998, Continental Airlines and Continental Express filed a
 lawsuit in Dallas federal court seeking a judicial declaration that the Bond
 Ordinance cannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from Love
 Field to Cleveland using regional jets. These two federal court lawsuits were
 consolidated and stayed.

      In December 1998, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued an order on
 the federal law questions concerning the Bond Ordinance, local proprietary
 powers, DFW's Use Agreement with DFW carriers such as American, and the Wright
 and 1997 Amendments, and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted by
 federal law and was therefore not enforceable. The DOT also found that the DFW
 Use Agreement did not preclude American from conducting interstate operations at
 Love Field. Fort Worth, American and DFW appealed the DOT's order to the Fifth
 Circuit Court of Appeals, and on February 1, 2000, the Fifth Circuit affirmed
 the DOT's order in all respects. American, Fort Worth and DFW each filed
 petitions for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which
 were denied on June 29, 2000. Shortly thereafter, American, Fort Worth and DFW
 dismissed all remaining motions and claims in the Texas state court litigation.
 Consequently, litigation over the right to provide scheduled passenger
 operations at Love Field on aircraft with fewer than 57 seats to destinations
 beyond the Wright Amendment perimeter has ended.
 
      In January 2000, the Department of Justice, at the behest of the DOT, filed
 a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
 Texas, Dallas Division, against Fort Worth and American seeking to enforce the
 DOT's order and to prevent any party from interfering with any carrier operating
 under that order.
 
      On May 1, 2000, American commenced service from Love Field to Chicago and
 Los Angeles using terminal space leased from Continental Express on a short-term
 basis. American has further announced that it will offer service from Love Field
 to New York's LaGuardia airport commencing August 31, 2000. American is seeking
 long-term facilities at Love Field from the City of Dallas for its Love Field
 operations. As a result of the foregoing, an increase in operations at Love
 Field and/or the inability of American to obtain adequate facilities to compete
 effectively at Love Field could adversely impact American's business.
 
 INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION
 
 Two competitors of the Company, UAL Corporation and US Airways Group, Inc.,
 recently announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. If
 that merger were to be consummated or other significant consolidation were to
 occur in the airline industry, conditions and competition in the industry could
 be significantly altered. If the Company were involved in a business combination
 with a competitor, the financial condition and prospects of the resulting
 corporation could be materially different from those of the Company.
