 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 VERSUS NINE MONTHS ENDED
 DECEMBER 31, 1998
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales.  Total rental
 revenue was $907.8 million and $848.8 million for the nine months
 ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Net revenues from the
 rental of moving related equipment increased by $56.5 million.  This
 increase is primarily attributable to higher truck rental revenues.
 The growth in truck rental revenue primarily reflects improved
 utilization, an increase in the average revenue per transaction and
 higher truck rental inventory.
 
      Net sales revenues were $148.7 million and $143.2 million for the
 nine months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Revenue
 growth from propane sales, which was up by 10.2% during the nine
 months ended December 31, 1999, and from the sale of moving support
 items (i.e. boxes, etc.), which was up by 3.5% during the nine months
 ended December 31, 1999, led to the improvement.
 
      Cost of sales was $87.7 million and $84.6 million for the nine
 months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  A higher sales
 volume contributed to the increase.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations increased to
 $721.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 1999 from $679.9
 million for the nine months ended December 31, 1998. Increased
 expenditure levels for rental equipment maintenance and personnel, due
 to an increase in truck rental transactions and in fleet size, were
 primarily responsible.
 
      Lease expense was $97.7 million and $87.5 million for the nine
 months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This increase
 reflects additional leasing activity over the past twelve months.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 31,
 1999 was $54.8 million, as compared to $45.0 million in the same
 period of the prior year.  The increase reflects an increase in
 depreciation recognized on the rental truck fleet.
 <PAGE> 23
 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $55.0 million
 and $56.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  Intercompany revenue was $53.1 million and $54.5
 million for the nine months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $5.7 million for the nine
 months ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $2.5 million during the
 same period of the prior year.  This increase correlates to a significant
 increase in average note and mortgage receivables outstanding.
 
      Operating expenses were $3.2 million for the nine months ended
 December 31, 1999 versus $4.7 million for the nine months ended
 December 31, 1998.  Reduced building maintenance expense accounted for
 the majority of the decline from the prior year.
 
      Lease expense for the nine months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 was
 $1.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  The increase reflects payments
 under a synthetic lease facility being utilized to develop storage properties.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 31, 1999 was
 $6.8 million, as compared to $8.5 million in the same period of the prior year.
 The decrease reflects higher gains from the disposition of property and lower
 levels of depreciable assets.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Republic's premiums were $100.3 million and $104.7 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease in
 premium for 1999 as compared to 1998 resulted from the U-Haul Liability
 programs in the rental industry, which decreased to $35.6 million from $50.9
 million, respectively.  This decrease resulted from the restructuring of the
 U-Haul Business Auto General Liability policy.  The deductible was changed at
 April 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to a 95% deductible.  This reduced
 premiums by $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 as
 compared to 1998.  The impact of this change will result in an overall savings
 of $0.6 million in premium taxes for 1999.  Additionally, assumed treaty
 reinsurance increased to $35.0 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1999 as compared to $34.0 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1998.  Direct multiple peril and general agency premium increased
 to $17.9 million and $11.6 million, respectively, for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1999 compared to $15.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively,
 for the nine months ended September 30, 1998.
 
      Net investment income was $24.8 million and $27.2 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease from 1998 to 1999 is attributable to a decrease in invested
 assets and a lower yield on reinvested funds.
 
      Benefits and losses were $82.4 million and $86.7 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease from 1998 to 1999 resulted from a decrease in the U-Haul
 Liability programs for unpaid reported claims corresponding to the
 decrease in premiums mentioned above.
 
      Deferred acquisition costs (DAC) consist of commissions and
 other costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the
 production of new business.  The prior year commissions, and other
 related expenses, are amortized over the following year.  The
 amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and
 1998 were $10.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively.  The
 increase from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to Republic's subsidiary
 company's DAC expense, which increased to $3.0 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 1999 from a negligible amount for the nine
 months ended September 30, 1998.  Also contributing was a $1.4 million
 increase in the nonaffiliated agents expense.  The Field Underwriting
 and Mobile Home programs increased due to 1998 written and unearned
 premiums and the Excess Worker's Compensation program increased due to
 1998 commission expenses relating to a settlement agreement with the
 previous general agent.
 
           Operating expenses were $23.5 million and $25.7 million for
 the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 Commissions decreased to $12.0 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1999 compared to $14.9 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1998.  This is mainly attributable to Republic's
 subsidiary's DAC earned for the nine months ended September 30, 1999.
 This subsidiary was purchased in December 1998; therefore, there was
 no DAC included for this subsidiary for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1998.  Additionally, there was an increase in the
 nonaffiliated agents and assumed treaty reinsurance DAC earned
 relating to the increase in the DAC expense mentioned above.  Slightly
 offsetting were increased lease expenses of $1.4 million and $0.8
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  All other underwriting expenses were $10.1 million and
 $10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.
 <PAGE> 24
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $9.1
 million and $14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  This represents a decrease in 1999 of $5.0
 million from 1998 and resulted mainly from decreased premium revenue
 and investment income.
 
 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $71.5 million and $71.4 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Oxford
 realized premium increases in the areas of Medicare supplement, credit
 life and disability and single premium whole life insurance products.
 Oxford increased Medicare supplement premium through the reinsurance
 of a block of policies and by adding direct premium through new
 programs; these increased premiums by $6.1 million.  Oxford began
 marketing a new single premium whole life policy in 1998; this product
 accounted for $2.9 million of new premiums in 1999 over 1998.  With the
 sale of NAFCIC, credit insurance premiums decreased by $4.3 million.
 As expected, premiums decreases occurred in non-essential NAI lines that
 were terminated and due to fewer annuitizations.  These changes accounted
 for a $4.7 million decrease in premiums through the first nine months of 1999.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $15.8
 million and $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  This increase is due to the increase in the
 average invested assets for the year, which was the result of new
 premium in 1999 and the increased asset base from the acquisition of
 NAI and Safe Mate.
 
      Benefits incurred were $44.6 million and $43.8 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This
 increase is primarily due to Medicare supplement benefits incurred.
 These benefits are related to the new business recorded in 1998.  The
 new Medicare supplement reinsurance accounted for $3.7 million of
 benefit variance.  Annuity benefits combined with the elimination of
 non-focused NAI health lines reduced benefits by $2.9 million.
 
      Amortization of DAC and the value of business acquired (VOBA) was
 $17.2 million and $19.7 million for the nine months ended September
 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Oxford defers commissions and other
 policy acquisition costs on single premium business.  These costs are
 amortized as the premium is earned over the term of the policy.
 Oxford continues to increase its single premium credit business in
 force, thus increasing both the deferred costs on the balance sheet
 and the subsequent amortization.  After Oxford purchased NAI in 1997,
 Oxford began dynamically amortizing the VOBA asset recognized at
 purchase.  This asset relates to the future profits of the credit
 insurance policies in force at the time of purchase.  The amortization of
 this asset led to higher 1998 amortization amounts.  In 1999, Oxford did
 not have amortization charges related to NAFCIC that were present in 1998.
 
      Operating expenses were $15.3 million and $12.7 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 Commissions have increased $1.5 million in 1999 in proportion to the
 increase in new premium.  Operating expenses, still within budgeted
 expectations, have increased in 1999 due to the expansion of business
 volume.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was
 $10.3 million and $9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.  The increase over the prior year reflects improved
 investment returns, a result of a higher asset base from new business and
 acquisitions, improving loss ratios on the Medicare supplement business and
 better than expected loss experience for the credit business.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $61.0 million for the nine months ended
 December 31, 1999, as compared to $55.0 million for the nine months
 ended December 31, 1998.  The increase can be attributed to an
 increase in average debt outstanding and a modest increase in the
 average cost of debt.
 <PAGE> 25
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings of $116.0 million
 were realized in the nine months ended December 31, 1999, as compared
 to $116.9 million for the same period in 1998.  After providing for
 income taxes, net earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 1999
 were $75.1 million, as compared to $75.9 million for the same period
 of the prior year.
 
 
 QUARTERLY RESULTS
      The following table presents unaudited quarterly results for the
 eleven quarters in the period beginning April 1, 1997 and ending
 December 31, 1999.  AMERCO believes that all necessary adjustments
 have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly, and
 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, its
 results.  U-Haul moving and storage operations are seasonal and
 proportionally more of AMERCO's revenues and net earnings from its
 U-Haul moving and storage operations are generated in the first and
 second quarters of each fiscal year (April through September).  The
 operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily
 indicative of results for any future period.

 QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 VERSUS QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales.  Rental
 revenue was $264.8 million and $249.9 million in the quarters ended
 December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This reflects a $14.9
 million increase in revenues from the rental of moving related
 equipment due to improved truck utilization, higher average revenue
 per transaction and higher truck rental inventory.
 
      Net sales revenues were $38.5 million in the quarter ended
 December 31, 1999 as compared to net sales of $35.6 million in the
 quarter ended December 31, 1998.  Revenue growth from the sale of
 propane and hitches led to the majority of the increase during the
 quarter.
 
      Cost of sales was $25.0 million in the quarter ended December 31, 1999,
 which represents an increase from $21.7 million for the same period of the
 prior year.  Increased material costs and a higher sales volume contributed
 to the increase.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany elimination increased to
 $244.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 1999 from $219.9
 million in the quarter ended December 31, 1998.  The increase reflects
 higher personnel and rental equipment maintenance expenditures
 associated with an increase in truck rental transactions and inventory
 levels.  Also contributing was an increase in advertising expense as providers
 shifted the publish dates of several directories to December 1999 to avoid
 possible Y2K problems.
 
      Lease expense was $34.1 million and $31.1 million for the quarters
 ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase reflects
 additional leasing activity.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 1999
 was $20.8 million, as compared to $18.7 million in the same period of
 the prior year.  The increase reflects an increase in depreciation
 recognized on the rental truck fleet.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $18.4 million
 in the quarter ended December 31, 1999, compared to $18.9 million in
 the quarter ended December 31, 1998.  Intercompany revenue was $17.8
 million as compared to $18.3 million in the prior year's third quarter.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $0.9 million in the
 quarter ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $1.1 million in the
 quarter ended December 31, 1998.
 
      Operating expenses were $1.3 million in the quarter ended
 December 31, 1999 versus $1.7 million in the quarter ended December 31, 1998.
 Reduced building maintenance expense accounted for the majority of the decline
 from the prior year.
 
      Lease expense was $0.7 million during the quarter ended December 31, 1999
 versus a negligible amount during quarter ended December 31, 1998.  The
 increase reflects payments under a synthetic lease facility being utilized to
 develop storage properties.
 
      Net depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 1999
 was $2.1 million, as compared to $2.8 million in the same period of the prior
 year.  The decrease reflects higher gains from the disposition of property.
 <PAGE> 28
 Property and Casualty
      Republic's premiums were $35.7 million and $39.5 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The premium
 decrease in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from the U-Haul Liability
 programs in the rental industry, which decreased to $11.7 million from
 $22.2 million, respectively.  This decrease resulted from the
 restructuring of the U-Haul Business Auto General Liability policy.
 The deductible was changed at April 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to
 a 95% deductible.  This reduced premiums by $10.9 million for the
 quarter ended September 30, 1999 as compared to 1998.  The result of
 this change will result in an overall savings of $0.6 million in
 premium taxes for 1999.  Assumed treaty reinsurance increased to
 $14.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 as compared to
 $10.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1998.  Direct multiple
 peril was $5.2 million and $5.4 million for the quarters ended
 September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  General agency premiums totaled
 $3.4 million and $1.4 million for the quarters ended September 30, 1999
 and 1998, respectively.
 
      Net investment income was $8.1 million and $9.0 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease from 1998 to 1999 resulted from a decrease in invested assets
 and a lower yield.
 
      Benefits and losses incurred were $28.7 million and $30.2 million
 for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease from 1998 to 1999 is due to a decrease in the U-Haul
 Liability programs for unpaid unreported claims corresponding to the
 decrease in premiums mentioned above.
 
      DAC consists of commissions and other costs, which vary with and
 are primarily related to the production of new business.  The prior
 year commissions, and other related expenses, are amortized over
 the following year.  Amortization expenses was $3.3 million and $3.0
 million for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 is mainly due to
 Republic's subsidiary company's DAC expenses, which increased to $1.1
 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 from a negligible
 amount for the quarter ended September 30, 1998.  Offsetting this
 increase were decreases in assumed treaty reinsurance of $0.5 million
 and in nonaffiliated agents of $0.1 million.
 
      Operating expenses were $7.8 million and $7.6 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Commissions
 increased slightly to $3.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1999
 compared to $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1998.  Lease
 expenses increased to $0.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1999
 as compared to $0.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1998.
 All other underwriting expenses were $3.8 million and $3.9 million
 for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $4.1
 million and $7.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  This represents a decrease in 1999 of $3.5
 million from 1998 and resulted mainly from decreased premium revenue
 and investment income, offset slightly by decreased underwriting expenses.
 Republic's operating profit will exceed fourth quarter expectations.

 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $24.3 million and $35.1 million for the quarters
 ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Oxford realized a
 premium decrease in the areas of Medicare supplement business.  In the third
 quarter of 1998, Oxford acquired a block of Medicare supplement policies
 through the reinsurance.  Through the acquisition accounting for this
 transaction, Oxford recognized the transferred reserves as premium in the
 quarter; this accounts for $7.6 million of the variance.  Production sales of
 Oxford's new single premium whole life policy increased by $0.6 million in the
 third quarter compared to 1998.  These increases were offset by fewer
 reinsurance annuitizations in 1999 than in 1998, leading to $0.8 million less
 in annuity premium.  Credit life and disability premiums decreased by
 $2.3 million for the quarter as a result of Oxford's sale of its NAFCIC
 subsidiary.  In addition, there were $0.7 million in premium decreases for
 the third quarter resulting from the planned termination of NAI products not
 part of Oxford's strategic focus.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $5.7
 million and $5.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  This increase is due to a larger invested base.
 
      Benefits incurred were $14.3 million and $20.3 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
 decrease relates to the Medicare supplement assumption mentioned above.
 These benefits accounted for $7.4 million of the decrease.  Related to
 the decrease in annuitizations in 1999 from 1998, annuity benefits
 decreased $0.5 million.  Benefits related to life insurance increased
 to $0.5 million from 1998 due to increased production in single
 premium whole life product.  Other Medicare supplement benefits
 increased $0.5 million for the quarter.  Credit insurance benefits
 increased by $0.9 million for the quarter.
 
      Amortization of DAC and VOBA was $6.1 million and $13.3 million
 for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 Oxford defers commissions and other policy acquisition costs on single
 premium business.  These costs are amortized as the premium is earned
 over the term of the policy.  Oxford continues to increase its single
 premium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferred
 costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization.  After
 Oxford purchased NAI in 1997, Oxford began dynamically amortizing the
 VOBA asset recognized at the time of purchase.  The amortization curve
 decreases as the underlying profits are recognized.  This asset
 relates to the future profits of the credit insurance policies in
 force at the time of purchase.  In addition, the amortization charge
 decreased due to the sale of NAFCIC.
 
      Operating expenses were $5.8 million and $3.6 million for the
 quarters ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Operating
 expenses for the quarter increased by $0.2 million stemming from the
 administration costs associated with new reinsurance contracts.
 Oxford's intercompany interest charges increased by $0.2 million for
 the outstanding surplus notes due AMERCO.  Other increases resulted
 from new product development activities.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was
 $3.8 million and $3.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  The increase stems from improved investment income
 performance for the quarter.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $21.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 1999,
 as compared to $18.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 1998.  The
 increase can be attributed to a higher level of average debt outstanding.
 
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, a pretax loss of $14.8 million was
 recognized during the quarter ended December 31, 1999, as compared to
 pretax earnings of $4.3 million for the same period in 1998.  After
 providing for income taxes, the net loss for the quarter ended
 December 31, 1999 was $9.3 million, as compared to net earnings of
 $2.5 million for the same period of the prior year.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain a large
 inventory of fixed asset rental items.  At December 31, 1999, net
 property, plant and equipment represented approximately 63.9% of total
 assets from non-insurance operations and approximately 43.1% of
 consolidated assets.  In the nine months ended December 31, 1999,
 capital expenditures were $269.5 million, as compared to $235.0
 million in the nine months ended December 31, 1998.  These
 expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck
 fleet.  The capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained
 through internally generated funds from operations and through lease
 financings.
 
      Cash flow from operations was $131.9 million in the nine months
 ended December 31, 1999, as compared to $65.8 million in the nine
 months ended December 31, 1998.  The increase results from a
 combination of earnings growth, higher levels of depreciation and
 amortization and changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
 
      At December 31, 1999, total outstanding notes and loans payable
 was $1,101.8 million as compared to $1,114.7 million at March 31, 1999.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $10.7 million for the
 nine months ended December 31, 1999.  Cash used by operating
 activities was $7.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 1998.
 The increase resulted from a combination of increased earnings
 and changes in other operating assets and liabilities.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Cash flows used by operating activities were $9.2 million and
 $29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively.  The 1999 to 1998 change resulted from decreased paid
 losses recoverable, decreased accounts receivable and a smaller
 increase in funds withheld.  Offsetting this increase in cash was a
 decrease in unearned premium reserves.
 
      Republic's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment
 portfolio were $1.4 million and $9.3 million at September 30, 1999 and
 1998, respectively.  The decrease from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the
 timing difference of maturities/calls being reinvested.  This level of
 liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet
 periodic needs.  Capital and operating budgets allow Republic to
 schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting
 proceeds.
 
      Republic maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio,
 primarily in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 94.1% of the fixed-
 income securities consisting of investment grade securities.  The
 maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to
 meet future cash needs.  Current liquidity remains strong with current
 invested assets equal to 108.4% of total liabilities.
 
      The liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon
 company historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment
 expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses
 paid to losses paid.  Unpaid loss and loss expenses are not
 discounted.
 
      Stockholder's equity was $216.1 million and $207.1 million at
 September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Republic considers current
 stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and
 absorb unforeseen risk events.  Republic does not use debt or equity
 issues to increase capital and therefore has no exposure to capital
 market conditions.

 Life Insurance
      Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from
 interest-sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses
 of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.
 Matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the
 types of insurance being written is an important consideration.
 Benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored to provide
 projections of future cash requirements.
 
      Cash flows provided by operating activities were $5.6 million and
 $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998,
 respectively. Cash flows provided/(used) by financing activities were
 approximately $(0.1) million and $10.1 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Cash flows from
 deferred annuity sales increase investment contract deposits, which
 are a component of financing activities, as well as the purchase of
 fixed maturities, which are a component of investing activities.  The
 decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities for the first
 nine months of 1999 compared to the first nine months of 1998 is due
 to lower ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals.
 
      In addition to cash flows from operating and financing
 activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through
 Oxford's short-term portfolio.  At September 30, 1999 and 1998, short-
 term investments were $52.1 million and $32.3 million, respectively.
 Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will
 continue to meet foreseeable cash needs.
 
      Stockholder's equity of Oxford decreased to $87.3 million in 1999
 from $96.2 million in 1998.  The decrease is a result of the
 unrealized losses on the available for sale investment portfolio.
 Oxford did not pay dividends in 1999 or 1998.
 
      Applicable laws and regulations of the State of Arizona require
 AMERCO's insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and
 surplus determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
 With respect to Oxford, the amount is $450,000.  In addition, the
 amount of dividends that can be paid to shareholders by insurance
 companies domiciled in the State of Arizona is limited.  Any dividend
 in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval.  Statutory
 surplus which can be distributed as dividends without regulatory
 approval is $0.7 million at September 30, 1999.  These restrictions
 are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
 AMERCO to meet its cash obligations.
 
 Consolidated Group
      During each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000, 2001 and
 2002, U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average
 approximately $325 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.
 This level of capital expenditures, combined with an average of
 approximately $30-$115 million in annual long-term debt maturities
 during this same period, are expected to create annual average funding
 needs of approximately $355-$440 million.  Management estimates that U-Haul
 will fund 100% of these requirements with internally generated funds, including
 proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales.
 
 Credit Agreements
      AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured
 medium-term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and
 foreign banks.  Principally to finance its fleet of trucks and
 trailers, AMERCO routinely enters into sale and leaseback
 transactions.  As of December 31, 1999, AMERCO had $1,101.8 million in
 total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized lines of
 credit of approximately $61.0 million.
 
      Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive
 financial and other covenants, including, among others, covenants with
 respect to incurring additional indebtedness, maintaining certain
 financial ratios and placing certain additional liens on its
 properties and assets.  At December 31, 1999, AMERCO was in compliance
 with these covenants.
 
      AMERCO is further restricted in the issuance of certain types of
 preferred stock.  AMERCO is prohibited from issuing shares of
 preferred stock that provide for any mandatory redemption, sinking
 fund payment, or mandatory prepayment, or that allow the holders
 thereof to require AMERCO or any subsidiary of AMERCO to repurchase
 such preferred stock at the option of such holders or upon the
 occurrence of any event or events without the consent of its lenders.
 
      Reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 in AMERCO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999
 for additional information about the credit agreements.

 Year 2000 Disclosure
      In preparation for any potential Year 2000 processing problems,
 AMERCO worked since 1997 to identify any changes necessary to its
 existing computerized business systems to make these systems compliant
 for Year 2000 processing.  AMERCO has spent approximately $2.8 million
 to date in its Year 2000 compliance efforts.  Since January 1, 2000,
 AMERCO has been assessing its information technology systems and has
 found no major Year 2000 processing problems.
