 OF OPERATIONS.
  
 OVERVIEW
  
      Ames changed its fiscal year from the last Saturday in January to the
 Saturday nearest January 31, effective with the fiscal year ended January 30,
 1999, which we refer to as "fiscal 1998." We made this change so that our fiscal
 year would coincide with the fiscal year of most other publicly-held retailers.
 Fiscal 1998 consisted of 52 weeks. Our fiscal year ended January 31, 1998, which
 we refer to as "fiscal 1997," consisted of 53 weeks. Our fiscal year ended
 January 25, 1997, which we refer to as "fiscal 1996," consisted of 52 weeks.
  
      You should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with the
 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in
 this Annual Report.
  
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
  
 FISCAL 1998 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1997
  
      On December 31, 1998, we acquired approximately 81.3% of the outstanding
 voting stock of Hills Stores Company. Accordingly, the operations of Hills and
 its subsidiaries during the month of January 1999 are included in our
 <PAGE>
 
 consolidated results of operations for fiscal 1998. Immediately following our
 acquisition of Hills, we began implementing a series of initiatives to prepare
 for the conversion of 150 of the Hills stores into Ames stores and the permanent
 closure of the five remaining Hills stores. These initiatives included the
 termination of most of Hills' corporate and administrative operations and
 personnel, the announced closure of seven Ames stores that we considered to be
 directly competitive with acquired Hills stores and the engagement of two
 experienced liquidation firms, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners and The Nassi
 Group, to operate the Hills stores until their closure and to liquidate Hills'
 merchandise inventories.
  
      Under our agreement with Gordon Brothers and The Nassi Group, we are
 entitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales, as a minimum
 guaranteed amount, 40% of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventory
 being sold, irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold. The remaining
 sale proceeds, net of the expenses of operating the stores, are payable to the
 liquidators as compensation for their services, subject to additional
 allocations to Ames to the extent the proceeds exceed specified targets. For
 financial reporting purposes, Hills' net sales during the month of January
 represent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales, its cost
 of merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that Ames is
 entitled to retain, and its selling, general and administrative expenses include
 the portion of those proceeds that are to be paid over to the liquidators.
  
      Because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with Gordon
 Brothers and The Nassi Group, as well as the fact that 50 Hills stores were in
 the process of liquidation, Hills' results for the month of January 1999 are not
 representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course of
 business and are not directly comparable to Ames' results exclusive of Hills.
 The acquisition of Hills also resulted in various costs and charges during the
 month of January 1999 that impacted Ames' consolidated results. These other
 costs and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminating
 contracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of Hills, the write-off of
 deferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility, interest expense
 for borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one-time charge for the
 announced closing of the seven Ames stores. The following table illustrates the
 separate contribution of Ames' full year of operations and Hills' one month of
 operations to various components of the consolidated results of operations for
 fiscal 1998, as well as the impact on these consolidated results of the other
 costs and charges described above:

 </TABLE>
  
      The unique circumstances under which Hills' operations have been conducted
 since December 31, 1998 and the accounting treatment accorded those operations
 as a consequence of our agreement with Gordon Brothers and The Nassi Group
 distort any direct comparison of the principal components of Ames' consolidated
 results for fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997. Accordingly, in the discussion that
 follows, Ames' net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative
 expense, and its leased department and other income for fiscal 1998 are
 presented and compared exclusive of the Hills results. The impact of the Hills
 acquisition is included in the comparison of depreciation and amortization
 expense and interest and debt expense.
 
      Ames' net sales (which exclude sales from leased shoe departments)
 increased 7.3%, to $2.40 billion in fiscal 1998 from $2.23 billion in fiscal
 1997, due primarily to 7.2% growth in same-store sales. Ames experienced
 particularly strong improvements in sales of domestics, toys, ready-to-assemble
 furniture and women's sportswear. In comparing results for the two fiscal years,
 you should bear in mind that net sales in fiscal 1997 were favorably affected by
 the inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operations of two stores that
 were closed in the beginning of fiscal 1998 and by the fact that fiscal 1997
 included one additional week of operations.
  
                                        14
 <PAGE>
      Ames' gross margin increased $45.7 million in fiscal 1998 compared to
 fiscal 1997, but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at 28.2%. The
 gross margin rate in fiscal 1998 benefitted from a higher average markup on
 sales, which was partially offset by higher markdowns.
  
      Ames' selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25.3 million
 in fiscal 1998, but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 26.0% in fiscal
 1997 to 25.3% in fiscal 1998. The percentage decrease was primarily attributable
 to a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense, partially
 offset by an increase in health and medical costs.
  
      Ames' leased department and other income increased $4.1 million, or 16.3%,
 in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. The increase was due primarily to the
 leased shoe department, layaway and vending income, as well as the receipt of
 funds previously held in a trust.
  
      Ames' depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.6 million, or
 69.1%, in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. The increase related primarily to
 new point-of-sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certain
 capital leases. The Hills acquisition added a further $3.2 million of
 depreciation and amortization expense associated with the additional
 depreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rights
 and the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the Hills acquisition
 cost over the value of the acquired assets. We are amortizing the beneficial
 lease rights using the straight-line method over the terms of the related leases
 (which average approximately 25 years) and are amortizing the Hills goodwill
 over 25 years on a straight-line basis. The amortization of the excess of our
 revalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same in
 fiscal 1998 as in fiscal 1997. We are amortizing this amount over a ten-year
 period that will conclude in January 2003.
  
      The Hills acquisition resulted in a 31.5%, or $3.7 million, increase in
 consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, in fiscal 1998. Debt and
 capital lease obligations of Hills accounted for $1.9 million of the increase.
 Another $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to the non-cash write-off
 of deferred financing costs under Ames' prior credit facility. The balance was
 attributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance the costs
 of the acquisition.
  
      In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, we recorded charges of $8.2 million
 in connection with the announced closing of seven Ames stores that are scheduled
 to close in fiscal 1999. Principal components of these charges are for lease
 costs and the write-down of fixed assets. We have also planned for the closing
 of five of the acquired Hills stores and, pursuant to the purchase method of
 accounting, have provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquired
 Hills assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, we recorded charges of
 $1.6 million in connection with the closing of two stores, of which
 $1.0 million was classified as a store closing charge and $0.6 million was
 recorded as part of the cost of merchandise sold.
  
      We recorded an income tax provision of $18.8 million in fiscal 1998, of
 which approximately $0.5 million will be paid in cash. In fiscal 1997, we
 recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million, of which approximately
 $0.3 million was paid in cash. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements for an explanation of fresh-start reporting and SFAS
 No. 109.
  
 FISCAL 1997 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1996
  
      We reported improvements in sales and net earnings for fiscal 1997 over
 fiscal 1996. The improvements were due to the favorable impact of our opening 21
 new stores in the preceding two fiscal years, our closing of 12 underperforming
 stores at the beginning of fiscal 1997 and the continued improvement in our
 gross margin rate.

 </TABLE>
  
      Net sales increased 3.3%, from $2.16 billion in fiscal 1996 to
 $2.23 billion in fiscal 1997, due to an increase of 2.1% in same-store sales,
 the inclusion of 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 1997 and the opening of new
 stores.
  
      Gross margin increased $33.5 million, or 0.6% as a percentage of net sales,
 in fiscal 1997. The gross margin rate was favorably impacted by a slightly
 higher average markup on sales and a reduction in markdowns. These factors were
 partially offset by higher volume of "55 Gold(Registered) Savings" senior
 citizen markdowns in fiscal 1997. Cost of merchandise sold in fiscal 1997
 included a $0.6 million charge for inventory write-downs associated with two
 stores that were designated for closing in fiscal 1998. Cost of merchandise sold
 in fiscal 1996 included a $2.8 million charge for inventory write-downs
 associated with 13 stores that were designated for closing in fiscal 1997.
  
      Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $17.3 million in
 fiscal 1997, but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales compared to
 fiscal 1996. The increase was primarily attributable to higher payroll expenses,
 a substantial portion of which was related to the inclusion of an additional
 week of operations and to federal minimum wage increases. Insurance expense
 increased due to a greater loss experience in fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal
 1996.
  
      Leased department and other income declined $0.7 million (or 2.7%) in
 fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996, due primarily to a decline in sales at
 leased shoe departments.
  
      Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.0 million, or 0.1% as
 a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 1997. Depreciation and amortization expense
 included impairment losses of $1.2 million in fiscal 1997 and $2.2 million in
 fiscal 1996 that were recorded pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 121 in the
 fourth quarter of fiscal 1995. Depreciation and amortization also included
 depreciation on capital additions subsequent to December 26, 1992, the date on
 which we wrote off all of our non-current assets in connection with the adoption
 of fresh-start reporting. The amortization of the excess of revalued net assets
 over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same in fiscal 1997 as in
 fiscal 1996. We are amortizing this amount over a ten-year period.
  
      Interest and debt expense, net of interest income, declined $7.4 million,
 or 0.4% as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 1997. The reduction was
 primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of deferred financing costs, a
 reduction in short-term interest expense and the favorable impact of lower
 outstanding long-term debt and capital lease balances. The decrease in
 short-term interest expense reflected a decrease in short-term borrowings
 (weighted average of $66.5 million in fiscal 1997 compared to $86.1 million in
 fiscal 1996) and a decrease in interest rates under our revolving credit
 facility. Our average outstanding long-term debt and capital lease balances
 decreased to $41.3 million in fiscal 1997 from $56.3 million in fiscal 1996.
  
                                        16
 <PAGE>
      During fiscal 1997, we realized proceeds of $1.9 million from the sale of
 our rights under a lease, which resulted in a deferred gain of $1.7 million to
 be recognized over a 20-year period. During fiscal 1996, we sold our rights
 under several leases for a total of $0.7 million in proceeds and recognized
 gains totaling $0.4 million.
  
      In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, we recorded charges of $1.6 million
 in connection with the closing of two stores, of which $1.0 million was
 classified as a store closing charge and $0.6 million was classified as part of
 the cost of merchandise sold. Both of the stores closed in February 1998. In the
 fourth quarter of fiscal 1996, we recorded charges of $9.7 million in connection
 with the closing of 13 stores. The $9.7 million is classified in two line items:
 $6.9 million as a store closing charge and $2.8 million as part of cost of
 merchandise sold.
  
      We recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million in fiscal 1997, of
 which approximately $0.3 million was paid in cash. In fiscal 1996, we recorded a
 non-cash income tax provision of $8.1 million.
  
      As a result of our termination of a revolving credit facility in December
 1996, we recorded in fiscal 1996 a non-cash extraordinary charge of
 $1.4 million, net of tax benefit of $0.6 million. The tax benefit was recorded
 as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. The charge was for the write-off
 of the deferred financing costs related to the facility.
  
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
  
      Our principal sources of liquidity are our bank credit facility, cash from
 operations and cash on hand. Our current bank credit facility consists of a
 revolving credit facility of up to $650.0 million, with a sublimit of
 $150.0 million for letters of credit, which expires June 30, 2002. Borrowings
 under the bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets
 and we are required to meet certain financial covenants after February 2000. In
 addition, we are required to maintain a minimum availability of at least
 $100.0 million. Our peak borrowing level in fiscal 1998 under this bank credit
 facility and a predecessor facility was $148.3 million. We believe we will have
 sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable
 future.
  
      Our cash position decreased by $22.1 million during fiscal 1998. The
 decrease was due primarily to $103.9 million paid out in the acquisition of
 Hills (net of cash acquired), $51.6 million of capital expenditures and
 $16.3 million in debt and capital lease payments, partially offset by
 $111.6 million in cash from operations and $44.9 million of borrowings under our
 bank credit facility. Our cash position increased by $11.7 million during fiscal
 1997. This increase was primarily due to $56.8 million of cash from operations,
 partially offset by $32.9 million of capital expenditures and $15.7 million of
 debt and capital lease payments.
  
      Merchandise inventories increased by $197.7 million in fiscal 1998 due to
 planned increases and the inclusion of $169.1 million of merchandise inventories
 of Hills. The Hills inventories have been valued at approximately 40% of the
 initial ticketed retail price of the merchandise, which represents the minimum
 amount we are entitled to retain out of the proceeds from the liquidation of the
 merchandise. Our merchandise inventories increased by $32.8 million in fiscal
 1997 as a result of planned increases as well as early receipts of additional
 merchandise for our 40th anniversary promotion held in March 1998. We use the
 first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting for inventories.
  
      Net fixed assets increased by $288.3 million during fiscal 1998 due to the
 inclusion of $230.9 million in net fixed assets of Hills and $77.5 million of
 capital expenditures, including $25.9 million in new point-of-sale information
 equipment and related software acquired under capital leases. The Hills net
 fixed assets were adjusted to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition
 date. In fiscal 1997, our net fixed assets increased by $19.7 million.
  
      Beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value of
 the acquired Hills leases over contract value of those leases. We are amortizing
 this amount over the terms of the related leases (which average approximately
 25 years) using the straight-line method. Goodwill is being amortized over
 25 years using the straight-line method.
  
      Accounts payable increased $173.6 million during fiscal 1998 due to
 improved payment terms and the inclusion of Hills accounts payable of $127.8
 million as of January 30, 1999. Accounts payable increased $34.2 million during
 fiscal 1997 due to improved payment terms and an increase in merchandise
 receipts in January 1998 over January 1997.
  
                                        17
 <PAGE>
      Long-term debt as of January 30, 1999 consisted of borrowings under our
 bank credit facility of $44.9 million and $50.9 million of Hills senior notes
 that remained outstanding after the acquisition.
  
      Capital lease and financing obligations increased by $165.5 million during
 fiscal 1998 due to the inclusion of $147.9 million of capital lease and
 financing obligations of Hills and $25.9 million of new capital leases.
  
      We have not paid any cash dividends during the past three fiscal years. The
 payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our bank credit
 facility.
  
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
  
      Capital expenditures for fiscal 1998 were $77.5 million, including
 $25.9 million in new point-of-sale information equipment and related software
 acquired pursuant to capital leases. The capital expenditure amount also
 included, among other items, the opening of six new stores, the remodeling of 22
 stores and the upgrading of certain management information systems. Capital
 expenditures for fiscal 1997 were $32.9 million and included, among other items,
 the opening of nine new stores, the remodeling of nine stores and the upgrading
 of certain management information systems, including the installation of new
 point-of-sale systems in ten stores.
  
      Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $210.0 million for
 fiscal 1999, primarily for the remodeling and conversion of 150 of the acquired
 Hills stores and nine former Caldor stores. We expect to finance conversion
 expenditures, including but not limited to, distribution center equipment
 purchases, store fixtures and equipment and remodeling expenses, through
 internally generated funds and borrowings under our bank credit facility. We
 expect to finance a substantial portion of new point-of-sale systems through
 capital leases. Land, buildings and improvements are financed principally
 through long-term leases.
  
 SEASONALITY
  
      Our business is seasonal in nature, with a large portion of our net sales
 occurring in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the
 back-to-school and Christmas shopping seasons. Net sales are highest in the last
 fiscal quarter (31.7% in fiscal 1998). The demand for working capital is
 heaviest in May, and from August through November, when sufficient merchandise
 must be purchased for the spring, back-to-school and Christmas seasons,
 respectively.
  
 YEAR 2000 READINESS
  
      In operating our business, we are dependent on information technology and
 process control systems that employ computers as well as embedded
 microprocessors. We also depend on the proper functioning of the business
 systems of third parties, particularly the more than 3,200 vendors from whom we
 purchase the merchandise sold in our stores. Many computer systems and
 microprocessors can only process dates in which the year is represented by two
 digits. As a result, some of these systems and processors may interpret "00"
 incorrectly as the year 1900 instead of the year 2000, in which event they could
 malfunction or become inoperable after December 31, 1999. Systems and processors
 that can properly recognize the year 2000 are referred to as "year 2000
 compliant."
  
      As previously reported, we initiated a comprehensive program to prepare our
 computer systems and applications for the year 2000. We have spent approximately
 $3.8 million on this program through the end of fiscal 1998 and expect that full
 implementation of the program will involve an additional $2.0 million to
 $2.5 million, including expenditures for software and consulting services.
 Additionally, we estimate the allocated costs of our internal system development
 staff who are implementing our year 2000 initiatives to be $3.5 million to
 $4.0 million over the life of the project.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
  
      The statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Management's
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
 elsewhere in this Annual Report that are not historical facts are
 "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities
 Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements include all discussions of
 strategy as well as statements that contain such forward-looking expressions as
 "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "will," "should," or
 "anticipates" or the negative thereof. In addition, from time to time, we or our
 representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in
 writing. Furthermore, forward-looking statements may be included in our filings
 with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in press releases or oral
 presentations made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive

      We caution you to bear in mind that forward-looking statements, by their
 very nature, involve assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and
 uncertainties. Although we believe that the assumptions and expectations
 reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, no
 assurance can be given that those assumptions or expectations will prove to have
 been correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
 materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:
  
      o deteriorating general economic conditions in the United States,
        particularly in the regions in which our stores are located;
  
      o decreased consumer spending, particularly among those consumers who
        comprise our primary customer base;
  
      o increased competition from other discount retailers, including major
        national chains, as well as from merchandise offerings on the Internet;
  
      o severe adverse weather conditions during the winter months, particularly
        during the peak Christmas holiday shopping season; and
  
      o failure of our suppliers to make their computer systems year 2000
        compliant in a timely manner.
  
      All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
 us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
 these factors and the cautionary statements contained herein.
