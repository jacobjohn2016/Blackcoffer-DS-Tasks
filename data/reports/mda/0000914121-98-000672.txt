           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations do not include the
 results of First Image for the period June 1, 1998 to June 30,  1998.  Inclusion
 of such  results  and  discussion  would not allow for a  meaningful  comparison
 between the periods presented.  Therefore, not included in the results below are
 revenues of $8.5 million,  EBITDA of $2.2 million and net income of $1.3 million
 for First Image for the period June 1, 1998 to June 30, 1998.
 
 Three  Months  Ended June 30, 1998  compared to the Three  Months Ended June 30,
 1997
 
 Results of Operations
 
 General
 
 Anacomp reported a net loss of $24.9 million for the three months ended June 30,
 1998,  compared to a net loss of $14.0  million for the three  months ended June
 30, 1997.  Included in the net loss for the three months ended June 30, 1998 and
 1997 is non-cash  amortization  of the Company's  Reorganization  Asset of $18.7
 million and $19.0 million, respectively.  Included in the net loss for the three
 months  ended June 30, 1998 is a one-time  restructuring  charge of $8.5 million
 resulting from planned data center  consolidations in conjunction with the First
 Image Acquisition. Also included in the net loss for the three months ended June
 30, 1998 is an extraordinary  loss on the early  extinguishment  of debt of $1.9
 million.  The extraordinary loss resulted from the write-off of unamortized debt
 issuance  costs related to the Company's  Old Facility  which was  refinanced in
 June 1998.
 
 Earnings  before  interest,   other  expense,   taxes,   restructuring  charges,
 depreciation and amortization  ("EBITDA") was $17.8 million for the three months
 ended June 30, 1998  compared to $19.1  million for the three  months ended June
 30, 1997.
 
 Total revenues for the third quarter of $112.5 million represents a $1.6 million
 decrease  from the  revenues  for the  third  quarter  of the prior  year.  This
 decrease is primarily due to the decline in the Company's micrographics supplies
 business.
 
 Cost of sales as a  percentage  of revenues  was 67% for the three  months ended
 June 30, 1998, compared to 67% for the same period of the prior year.
 
 Selling,  general  and  administrative   expenses,   excluding  amortization  of
 intangible assets, were 21% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 1998,
 compared to 19% for those months ended June 30, 1997.  These increased costs are
 primarily due to  investments in product  development  and sales support for the
 digital systems products.
 
 Products and Services
 
 Outsource services revenues,  which include COM and ALVA CD services,  increased
 $5.4  million,  or 21%, for the three months ended June 30, 1998 compared to the
 same three months of fiscal 1997.  Outsource  services  volumes  increased  27%,
 while the average  selling  price  decreased  11%. Data center  acquisitions  in
 Europe as well as several  large  customer  gains have  contributed  to both the
 increase in volumes and the decrease in average selling price. The acquired data
 centers  contributed  volumes,  but at somewhat lower selling prices.  The large
 customer gains received favorable pricing due to their volumes. Gross margins as
 a percentage of revenue  decreased by two percentage points due to the impact of
 the lower average selling price.
 
 Technical services (primarily  maintenance)  revenues decreased $466,000 for the
 three months ended June 30, 1998  compared to the prior year,  primarily  due to
 the decrease in the  population of older  generation COM systems in the customer
 base.  Gross  margins as a percentage  of revenue  decreased  by two  percentage
 points compared to the same period of the prior year.
 
 COM systems revenues for the three months ended June 30, 1998 increased $411,000
 or 7%  compared  to the same  period  of the  prior  year.  Gross  margins  as a
 percentage of revenue  increased by six percentage  points  compared to the same
 period of the prior year.
 
 Digital  systems  revenues  for the three  months  ended June 30, 1998 were $2.5
 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior year.
 
 Micrographics  supplies  revenues  for the  three  months  ended  June 30,  1998
 decreased  $6.4  million  compared to the same  period of the prior  year.  This
 decrease is due to the decline in original COM film and duplicate film, which is
 consistent with long-term  trends as well as the  discontinuance  of the sale of
 duplicate film to the reseller market.  Gross margins as a percentage of revenue
 improved by two percentage points due primarily to changes in product mix.
 
 Magnetic  media  revenues and gross  margins for the three months ended June 30,
 1998 were comparable to the same period of the prior year.
 
 Nine Months Ended June 30, 1998 compared to the Nine Months Ended June 30, 1997
 
 Results of Operations
 
 General
 
 Anacomp  reported a net loss of $56.1 million for the nine months ended June 30,
 1998,  compared to net loss of $54.0  million for the nine months ended June 30,
 1997.  Included in the net loss for the nine months ended June 30, 1998 and 1997
 is non-cash amortization of the Company's  Reorganization Asset of $56.2 million
 and $56.9  million,  respectively.  Included in the net loss for the nine months
 ended June 30, 1998 is a one-time restructuring charge of $8.5 million resulting
 from planned data center  consolidations  in conjunction  with the  Acquisition.
 Also  included in the net loss for the nine months  ended June 30, 1998 and 1997
 were  extraordinary  losses on the  extinguishment  of debt of $1.9  million and
 $11.7 million,  respectively.  The extraordinary  loss for the nine months ended
 June 30, 1998 was the result of the early  extinguishment  of the  Company's Old
 Facility and the associated  write-off of unamortized  debt issuance costs.  The
 extraordinary loss for the nine months ended June 30, 1997 was comprised of a 3%
 call premium and the  write-off of  unamortized  discount on the  Company's  13%
 Subordinated Notes.
 
 Pursuant to a 1990 OEM agreement,  Kodak was obligated to purchase an additional
 151 XFP 2000 systems by October  1997 or pay a cash  penalty to the Company.  In
 satisfaction of this earlier OEM agreement,  the Company accepted a $3.6 million
 cash  payment  from Kodak,  which is included in the results for the nine months
 ended June 30, 1997.
 
 EBITDA,  excluding the Kodak payment noted above, was $55.6 million for the nine
 months ended June 30, 1998,  compared to $58.9 million for the nine months ended
 June 30, 1997.
 
 Total  revenues  for the nine  months  ended  June 30,  1998 of  $347.9  million
 represents  a $6.5  million  increase  from the same  period of the prior  year,
 excluding the Kodak payment noted above. A variety of factors contributed to the
 higher  revenues,  including  large COM services  contracts  with new customers,
 higher volumes in COM and CD services from existing customers,  and the positive
 effect of acquisitions.  These  improvements were offset by expected  historical
 declines in micrographics supplies.
 
 Cost of sales as a  percentage  of revenues  was 66% for the nine  months  ended
 June 30, 1998, compared to 66% for the same period of the prior year.
 
 Selling,  general  and  administrative   expenses,   excluding  amortization  of
 intangible  assets,  was 21% of revenue for the nine months  ended June 30, 1998
 and 19% for the nine months ended June 30,  1997,  excluding  the one-time  $3.6
 million  payment  noted  above.  These  increased  costs  are  primarily  due to
 investments in the Company's  sales force and in product  development  and sales
 support for the digital systems products.
 
 Interest expense and fee amortization of $24.4 million for the nine months ended
 June 30, 1998, decreased $3.5 million over the prior year, primarily due to more
 favorable  interest  rates  and  reduction  in debt  levels  as a result  of the
 refinancing of substantially  all of the Company's  significant debt obligations
 during the second quarter of fiscal 1997.
 
 Products and Services
 
 Outsource services revenues,  which include COM and ALVA CD services,  increased
 $17.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 1998, compared to the same nine
 months of fiscal year 1997.  Outsource  service  volumes  increased by 30% while
 average selling prices  decreased by 11%. Data center  acquisitions  and several
 large  customer  gains have  contributed to both the increase in volumes and the
 decrease in average  selling  prices.  The  acquired  data  centers  contributed
 volumes,  but at significantly  lower average selling prices. The large customer
 gains  received  favorable  pricing  due to their  volumes.  Gross  margins as a
 percentage of revenue  decreased by approximately  two percentage  points due to
 the aforementioned impact of lower average selling prices.
 
 Technology services (primarily  maintenance) revenues decreased $2.8 million for
 the nine months  ended June 30, 1998,  primarily  due to the effect of replacing
 older  generation  COM  systems  with  the XFP  2000  COM  System,  which  has a
 significantly  greater  capacity than the older COM systems.  Gross margins as a
 percentage  of revenue  remained  level.
 
 COM systems  revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 1998  increased by $4.5
 million  compared to the same period of the prior year.  The increase in revenue
 is  attributable  to an increase  in the number of systems  sold and the mix and
 pricing  of new and used  systems.  Gross  margins  as a  percentage  of revenue
 improved five percentage  points  primarily due to product mix and the result of
 manufacturing efficiencies realized during fiscal 1998.
 
 Digital  systems  revenues for the nine months  ended June 30,  1998,  were $9.3
 million  compared to $6.6 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the
 contribution from a business acquired in October 1997.
 
 Micrographics  supplies  revenues  for the nine  months  ended  June  30,  1998,
 decreased  $16.9  million  compared to the same  period of the prior year.  This
 decrease is due to the decline in original COM film and duplicate film, which is
 consistent with long-term  trends as well as the  discontinuance  of the sale of
 duplicate film to the reseller market.  Gross margins as a percentage of revenue
 remained level.
 
 Magnetic  media  revenues  and gross  margins for the nine months ended June 30,
 1998 remained level compared to the same period of the prior year.
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
 Anacomp's  working  capital at June 30, 1998,  excluding the current  portion of
 long-term  debt, was $62.4  million,  compared to $41.4 million at September 30,
 1997. Net cash used in operating  activities was $7.0 million for the first nine
 months of fiscal 1998, compared to net cash provided by operating  activities of
 $35.5 million in the comparable prior period. The change in net cash provided by
 (used in)  operating  activities  was  caused by a $10  million  payment  on the
 Company's trade credit facility and by usual working capital  changes.  Net cash
 used in investing  activities was $172.9 million in the current period  compared
 to $25.6 million in the  comparable  prior period.  The fiscal 1998  investments
 were significantly higher because of the Acquisition.
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $133.6 million for the nine months
 ended June 30, 1998,  compared to net cash used in financing  activities of $7.8
 million  in  the  comparable  prior  period.   The  fiscal  1998  proceeds  were
 significantly  higher  because of new  subordinated  debt  issued to finance the
 Acquisition.  The Company's  successful  rights  offering of  approximately  3.6
 million  shares of common stock  provided  approximately  $24.3  million in cash
 during the first three quarters of fiscal 1997.  The company's debt  refinancing
 and  principal  reductions  during  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  1997  used
 approximately $31.3 million of cash.
 
 The Company's cash balance  (including  restricted cash) as of June 30, 1998 was
 $15.7 million, compared to $65.5 million at September 30, 1997. The decrease was
 primarily due to cash used for  acquisitions.  The Company also has availability
 of $26.1 million on its $80 million  revolving credit facility at June 30, 1998.
 In addition,  the Company intends to pay off the outstanding  balance of the New
 Facility by  September  30, 1998 using cash  generated  from the sale of the DAS
 Business and the DPDS Business and from operations.
 
 The Company has significant debt service obligations. The ability of the Company
 to meet its debt  service  and other  obligations  will  depend  upon its future
 performance  and is subject to financial,  economic and other  factors,  some of
 which are beyond its control.  However,  the Company believes that cash on hand,
 cash generated from operations and cash available under the New Facility will be
 sufficient to fund its debt service  requirements,  acquisition  strategies  and
 working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
 
 Year 2000
 
 Anacomp has undertaken a comprehensive "Year 2000" program for the products that
 it sells or distributes in the marketplace.  Under this program, the Company has
 sought to assess all of its critical software and hardware products to determine
 what  remediation,  if any, is  necessary  for the proper  functioning  of these
 systems  in the year 2000 and  beyond.  The  Company  is also  working  with its
 outside  vendors to ensure that they will  continue to support the products that
 the vendors  supply to Anacomp  for resale,  including  the  performance  by the
 vendors of any required Year 2000 remediation.
 
 Anacomp is also in the process of analyzing  the  software and hardware  systems
 that it uses  internally  to determine if there are any Year 2000 issues.  Where
 necessary,  the Company is updating  its  internal  systems and working with the
 vendors of any products from whom the Company still receives support.
 
 Based upon its  assessment  to date,  Anacomp  believes  that it will be able to
 complete all required  remediation  of its supported and internal  products in a
 timely fashion,  and that the effort and the cost of such  remediation  will not
 have a material  effect upon the Company's  results of operations,  liquidity or
 capital resources. The Company expenses these costs as they are incurred.
 
 Nevertheless,  there  can be no  assurance  that  the  Company  will  be able to
 complete all of such remediation in the required time frame, or that the Company
 will  be able  to  identify  all  Year  2000  issues  before  problems  manifest
 themselves.  Further,  it is possible  that the future  level of expenses in the
 Company's remediation efforts could rise significantly. Finally, there can be no
 assurance  that,  if left  unremedied,  the products  that the Company  sells or
 distributes would remain competitive in the marketplace or the products that the
 Company uses internally would not have a material effect upon the ability of the
 Company to report its financial results.
 
 Anacomp  has set a goal of  completing  its Year  2000  program,  including  all
 required  remediation  work, by December 31, 1998, both for the products that it
 supports and for the products that it uses  internally.  The Company is hopeful,
 however,  that it will  complete its program for certain of its products  before
 that internal deadline.
