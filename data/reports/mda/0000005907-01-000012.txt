            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
 
 OVERVIEW
 
          AT&T Corp.  (AT&T or the  company) is among the world's  communications
 leaders, providing voice, data, video and broadband  telecommunications services
 to large and small  businesses,  consumers and government  agencies.  We provide
 domestic  and  international  long  distance;   regional,   local  and  wireless
 communications  services;  cable television and Internet communication services.
 AT&T also provides billing,  directory and calling-card  services to support our
 communications businesses.
 
 MERGER WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC.
 
          We completed the merger with MediaOne  Group,  Inc.  (MediaOne) on June
 15, 2000, in a cash and stock  transaction  valued at approximately $45 billion.
 We issued  approximately  603 million shares,  of which 60 million were treasury
 shares, and made cash payments of approximately $24 billion.
 
          The merger was recorded under the purchase  method of  accounting,  and
 accordingly,  the  results of MediaOne  have been  included  with the  financial
 results of AT&T,  within our Broadband  segment,  since the date of acquisition.
 Periods  prior to the  merger  were not  restated  to  include  the  results  of
 MediaOne.
 
 TRACKING STOCKS
 
          On  April  27,  2000,  AT&T  issued a new  class of stock to track  the
 performance  of AT&T  Wireless  Group.  AT&T  sold 360  million  shares  of AT&T
 Wireless Group tracking  shares at a price of $29.50 per share.  The 360 million
 shares track  approximately  16% of the financial  performance  of AT&T Wireless
 Group.
 
          In   addition,   in   connection   with   the   1999   acquisition   of
 Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), renamed AT&T Broadband (Broadband), AT&T issued
 a separate tracking stock to reflect the financial  performance of Liberty Media
 Group (LMG), TCI's former programming and technology investment businesses.  The
 outstanding  Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock tracks 100% of the  financial
 performance of LMG.
 
          The remaining  results of operations of AT&T,  including  approximately
 84% of the financial  performance of AT&T Wireless Group, are referred to as the
 AT&T Common Stock Group and are represented by AT&T common stock.
 
          A  tracking  stock is  designed  to  provide  financial  returns to its
 holders based on the financial  performance  and economic value of the assets it
 tracks.  Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless Group tracking
 stock or Liberty  Media Class A or B tracking  stock does not represent a direct
 legal  interest  in the  assets and  liabilities  of any of the  groups,  but an
 ownership  of AT&T in total.  The specific  shares  represent an interest in the
 economic performance of the net assets of each of the groups.
 
          The   earnings   attributable   to  AT&T   Wireless   Group   represent
 approximately  16% of the  earnings  from April 27, 2000,  through  December 31,
 2000,  and are excluded from the earnings  available to AT&T Common Stock Group.
 Similarly, the earnings and losses related to LMG are excluded from the earnings
 available to AT&T Common Stock Group.
 <PAGE>
 
          We do not have a  controlling  financial  interest in LMG for financial
 accounting  purposes;  therefore,  our  ownership  in  LMG  is  reflected  as an
 investment  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  in  AT&T's  consolidated
 financial  statements.  The amounts  attributable  to LMG are  reflected  in the
 accompanying consolidated financial statements as "Equity earnings (losses) from
 Liberty  Media  Group"  and  "Investment  in  Liberty  Media  Group and  related
 receivables, net".
 
 RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T
 
          On October 25, 2000,  we  announced a  restructuring  plan  designed to
 fully  separate  or issue  separately  tracked  stocks  intended  to reflect the
 financial  performance  and economic  value of each of the company's  four major
 operating  units.  Upon completion of the plan,  AT&T Wireless,  AT&T Broadband,
 AT&T  Business and AT&T  Consumer  will all be  represented  by  asset-based  or
 tracking stocks.
 
          As part of the first phase of the  restructuring  plan, we are planning
 an exchange offer that will give AT&T  shareowners  the  opportunity to exchange
 any  portion of their AT&T  common  shares  for  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group
 tracking stock, subject to pro-ration.  Following the exchange offer and subject
 to specified conditions,  AT&T plans to split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T.
 We intend,  however,  to retain up to $3 billion of shares of AT&T  Wireless for
 future sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.
 We expect AT&T Wireless  will become an  independent,  publicly-held  company in
 mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals.
 
          In  addition  to the  split-off  of AT&T  Wireless,  we intend to fully
 separate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial  performance
 and economic value of each of our other major business  units. We plan to create
 and issue new classes of stock to track the financial  performance  and economic
 value of our AT&T  Broadband  unit and AT&T Consumer  unit. We plan to sell some
 percentage of shares of the AT&T Broadband  unit in the fall of 2001.  Within 12
 months of such sale, we intend to completely  separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T,
 as an  asset-based  stock.  The AT&T Consumer  tracking  stock is expected to be
 fully distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of 2001.
 
          AT&T  expects  that  these   transactions  will  be  tax-free  to  U.S.
 shareholders.   AT&T's   restructuring   plan  is  complicated  and  involves  a
 substantial  number  of steps  and  transactions,  including  obtaining  various
 conditions,  such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings. In addition, future
 financial conditions,  superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occur
 that make it  inadvisable  to proceed  with part or all of AT&T's  restructuring
 plan. Any or all of the elements of AT&T's  restructuring  plan may not occur as
 we currently  expect or in the timeframes that we currently  contemplate,  or at
 all.  Alternative forms of restructuring,  including sales of interests in these
 businesses,  would reduce what is available for  distribution  to shareowners in
 the restructuring.
 
          On November 15, 2000, we announced that our board of directors voted to
 split-off  LMG.  A new  asset-based  security  will be issued to  holders of LMG
 tracking stock in exchange for their LMG tracking shares.  The split-off remains
 subject to receipt  of a  favorable  tax  ruling  from the IRS.  We expect  this
 split-off to be completed in mid-2001.

          This document may contain  forward-looking  statements  with respect to
 AT&T's  restructuring plan,  financial  condition,  results of operations,  cash

 flows, dividends,  financing plans, business strategies,  operating efficiencies
 or synergies,  budgets,  capital and other  expenditures,  network build out and
 upgrade,  competitive positions,  availability of capital,  growth opportunities
 for  existing  products,  benefits  from  new  technologies,   availability  and
 deployment of new  technologies,  plans and objectives of management,  and other
 matters.
 
          These forward-looking statements,  including, without limitation, those
 relating to the future business prospects,  revenue, working capital, liquidity,
 capital needs,  network build out,  interest costs and income,  are  necessarily
 estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number
 of risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially
 from those suggested by the forward-looking  statements.  These  forward-looking
 statements  should,  therefore,  be  considered  in light of  various  important
 factors that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from estimates or
 projections  contained  in the  forward-looking  statements  including,  without
 limitation:
 
          o        the  risks  associated  with  the   implementation  of  AT&T's
                   restructuring  plan,  which  is  complicated  and  involves  a
                   substantial   number  of  different   transactions  each  with
                   separate  conditions,  any or all of which may not occur as we
                   currently  intend,  or which may not occur in the timeframe we
                   currently expect,
 
          o        the risks  associated with each of AT&T's main business units,
                   operating as independent  entities as opposed to as part of an
                   integrated telecommunications provider following completion of
                   AT&T's  restructuring  plan,  including the inability of these
                   groups to rely on the financial and  operational  resources of
                   the  combined  company  and these  groups  having  to  provide
                   services that were previously  provided by a different part of
                   the combined company,
 
          o        the impact of existing and new  competitors  in the markets in
                   which these groups  compete,  including  competitors  that may
                   offer less  expensive  products  and  services,  desirable  or
                   innovative  products,   technological  substitutes,   or  have
                   extensive resources or better financing.
 
          o        the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting  from excessive
                   deployment of network capacity,
 
          o        the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in
                   the  telecommunications  industry,  which  trend  may have the
                   effect of making the  competitors of these entities larger and
                   better  financed and afford these  competitors  with extensive
                   resources  and  greater  geographic  reach,  allowing  them to
                   compete more effectively,
 
          o        the  effects of vigorous  competition  in the markets in which
                   the  company  operates,  which may  decrease  prices  charged,
                   increase  churn and change  customer  mix,  profitability  and
                   average revenue per user,
 
          o        the ability to enter into agreements  to provide, and the cost
                   of  entering  new  markets   necessary to  provide, nationwide
                   services,
 <PAGE>
 
          o        the  ability to establish a significant market presence in new
                   geographic  and service markets,
 
          o        the  availability and cost of capital and  the consequences of
                   increased leverage,
 
          o        the successful  execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic
                   assets as part of an overall  corporate deleveraging plan,
 
          o        the  potential  impact  of NTT  DoCoMo's  investment  in AT&T,
                   including  provisions  of the  agreements  that  restrict AT&T
                   Wireless  Group's future  operations,  and provisions that may
                   require AT&T to repurchase  DoCoMo's  interest in AT&T if AT&T
                   or AT&T Wireless Group fail to meet specified conditions,
 
          o        the  impact  of  any  unusual  items  resulting  from  ongoing
                   evaluations  of  the  business  strategies of the company,
 
          o        the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to
                   competitors by the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) or
                   state regulatory  commissions under the Telecommunications Act
                   of 1996 or other applicable laws and regulations,
 
          o        the  risks  and  costs  associated  with  the  need to acquire
                   additional wireless  spectrum for current and future services,
 
          o        the   risks  associated   with    technological  requirements,
                   technology  substitution and changes   and other technological
                   developments,
 
          o        the  results of  litigation filed  or to be  filed against the
                   company,
 
          o        the  possibility  of one or more of the  markets  in which the
                   company  competes  being  impacted  by changes  in  political,
                   economic or other factors,  such as monetary policy, legal and
                   regulatory  changes or other external factors over which these
                   groups have no control, and
 
          o        the  risks  related  to AT&T's  investments  in LMG  and joint
                   ventures.

          The   discussion  and  analysis  that  follows   provides   information
 management  believes is relevant to an assessment  and  understanding  of AT&T's
 consolidated  results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000,  1999
 and 1998, and financial condition as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.
 
 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
          The  comparison of 2000 results with 1999 was impacted by events,  such
 as  acquisitions  and  dispositions  that occurred  during these two years.  For
 
 <PAGE>
 
 example,  in  2000 we  acquired  MediaOne  and  wireless  properties  in the San
 Francisco Bay area, which were both included in our 2000 results for part of the
 year,  but were not in 1999  results.  In 1999,  we acquired TCI, the IBM Global
 Network  (now AT&T  Global  Network  Services,  or AGNS) and  Vanguard  Cellular
 Systems,  Inc. (Vanguard).  These businesses were included in 2000 results for a
 full  year,  but  only  a  part  of  1999  (since  their   respective  dates  of
 acquisition).  Further, we disposed of certain  international  businesses during
 1999 and 2000.  The  results of  businesses  sold in 1999 were  included in 1999
 results for part of the year, and were not in 2000 results. Likewise, businesses
 sold in 2000 were included in 1999 results for the full year and in 2000 results
 for part of the year.
 
          Year-over-year  comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of At
 Home   Corp.    (Excite@Home)    beginning    September   1,   2000,    due   to
 corporate-governance  changes  which gave AT&T a controlling  interest.  At that
 time and on December 31, 2000, we had an approximate  23% economic  interest and
 74% voting interest in Excite@Home. Prior to September 1, 2000, we accounted for
 our ownership in Excite@Home under the equity method of accounting,  which means
 our investment was included in "Other  investments and related  advances" in the
 1999  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet and any earnings or losses were included as a
 component  of "Net losses from other  equity  investments"  in the  Consolidated
 Statements of Income. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusion
 of 100% of its results in each line item of AT&T's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet
 and Consolidated Income Statement. The approximate 77% we do not own is shown in
 the  2000  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  within  "Minority  interest"  and  as a
 component of  "Minority  interest  income  (expense)"  in the 2000  Consolidated
 Statement of Income.
 
          On January 5, 2000, we launched Concert,  our global joint venture with
 British  Telecommunications  plc (BT). AT&T contributed all of its international
 gateway-to-gateway   assets  and  the  economic  value  of   approximately   270
 multinational  customers specifically targeted for direct sales by Concert. As a
 result,  2000  results do not include the revenue and expenses  associated  with
 these  customers and  businesses,  while 1999 does, and 2000 results include our
 proportionate  share of  Concert's  earnings in "Net  losses  from other  equity
 investments."
 
          Effective  July 1,  2000,  the  FCC  eliminated  Primary  Interexchange
 Carrier  Charges (PICC or per-line  charges) that AT&T pays for  residential and
 single-line  business  customers.  The  elimination  of these  per-line  charges
 resulted  in lower  access  expense  as well as lower  revenue,  since  AT&T has
 historically billed its customers for these charges.
 
          The  comparison of 1999 results with 1998 was also impacted by the 1999
 acquisitions  of TCI,  AGNS and  Vanguard,  since  1999  results  include  these
 businesses  for part of the  year,  while  1998  does  not  include  them.  This
 comparison  is  also  impacted  by  the  1999   dispositions  of   international
 businesses,  which were included in 1999 results for part of the year,  but were
 in 1998 results for the full year.

 </TABLE>
 <PAGE>
 
          Total revenue  increased  5.4%, or $3.4 billion,  in 2000 compared with
 the prior year. Approximately $2.1 billion of the increase was due to the impact
 of acquisitions and the  consolidation  of Excite@Home,  offset by the impact of
 Concert,  dispositions  and the  elimination of PICC. The remaining $1.3 billion
 increase was primarily  driven by a growing demand for our wireless and data and
 Internet protocol (IP) products,  and outsourcing services,  partially offset by
 continued and  accelerating  declines in long distance voice revenue.  We expect
 long  distance  revenue  to  continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  ongoing
 competition and product substitution.
 
          Total revenue in 1999 increased $9.4 billion,  or 17.6%,  compared with
 1998.  Nearly  three-quarters  of the increase was due to  acquisitions,  net of
 dispositions.  The remaining increase was fueled by growth in wireless, business
 data, business long distance voice and outsourcing revenue,  partially offset by
 the continued decline of consumer long distance voice revenue.
 
          Revenue by  segment  is  discussed  in  greater  detail in the  segment
 results section.

 Costs of services and products........................................       $17,587      $14,594     $10,495
 </TABLE>
 
          Costs of  services  and  products  include the costs of  operating  and
 maintaining our networks, costs to support our outsourcing contracts,  fees paid
 to other wireless carriers for the use of their networks (off-network  roaming),
 programming and licensing costs for cable services,  costs of wireless  handsets
 sold,  the provision for  uncollectible  receivables  and other  service-related
 costs.
 
          These costs  increased  $3.0 billion,  or 20.5%,  in 2000 compared with
 1999. Nearly $2.1 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the impact
 of  consolidating  Excite@Home,  net of the impact of Concert and divestments of
 international businesses.  The higher costs associated with our growing wireless
 subscriber  base  and  wireless  network  as well as new  outsourcing  contracts
 increased expenses by approximately  $1.5 billion.  The higher wireless expenses
 primarily  related to higher costs of handsets  sold, due to a 53.5% increase in
 gross subscriber  additions in 2000 compared with 1999.  Expenses also increased
 due to higher  video-programming  costs  principally due to rate increases,  and
 higher  costs  associated  with new  broadband  services of  approximately  $0.3
 billion.  These increases were partially offset by approximately $0.9 billion of
 costs  savings from  continued  cost control  initiatives  and a higher  pension
 credit in 2000, primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base, resulting
 from increased investment returns.
 
          Costs of services and products  rose $4.1  billion,  or 39.1%,  in 1999
 compared with 1998,  primarily due to acquisitions,  net of dispositions,  which
 accounted  for  approximately  $3.7  billion of the  increase.  The higher costs
 associated with our growing wireless  subscriber base as well as new outsourcing
 contracts increased expenses by approximately $1.5 billion. Partially offsetting
 the 1999 increases were network  cost-control  initiatives of approximately $0.4
 billion,  and approximately  $0.3 billion of lower expenses in Business Services
 related  to  per-call   compensation   expense,   provision  for   uncollectible
 receivables and gross receipts and property taxes.

 </TABLE>
 
          Access and other connection  expenses  decreased 8.0%, to $13.5 billion
 in 2000,  compared with $14.7 billion in 1999.  Included within access and other
 connection  expenses  are costs  that we pay to  connect  domestic  calls on the
 facilities of other service providers.  Mandated reductions in per-minute access
 costs and decreased  per-line  charges  resulted in lower costs of approximately
 $1.5  billion.  Also  contributing  to the decrease was more  efficient  network
 usage.  These decreases were partially offset by  approximately  $0.7 billion of
 higher  costs due to volume  increases,  and $0.5  billion as a result of higher
 Universal  Service Fund  contributions.  Since most of these  charges are passed
 through  to  the  customer,  the  per-minute  access-rate  and  per-line  charge
 reductions and the increased Universal Service Fund contributions have generally
 resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue.
 
          Costs paid to  telephone  companies  outside  of the  United  States to
 connect  calls made to  countries  outside of the United  States  (international
 settlements)  are also  included  within access and other  connection  expenses.
 These  costs  decreased  approximately  $0.5  billion in 2000,  as result of the
 commencement  of  operations  of  Concert.   Concert  now  incurs  most  of  our
 international  settlements as well as earns most of our foreign-billed  revenue,
 previously  incurred and earned  directly by AT&T. In 2000,  Concert billed us a
 net expense composed of international settlement  (interconnection)  expense and
 foreign-billed  revenue.  The  amount  charged by Concert in 2000 was lower than
 interconnection expense incurred in 1999, since AT&T recorded these transactions
 as revenue and expense,  as  applicable.  Partially  offsetting the decline were
 costs incurred related to Concert products that AT&T now sells to its customers.
 
          Access and other connection expenses declined $0.6 billion, or 4.2%, in
 1999  compared with the prior year.  This decline  resulted from $0.9 billion of
 mandated  reductions  in  per-minute  access  rates in 1999 and  1998,  and $0.6
 billion of lower international  settlement rates resulting from our negotiations
 with  international  carriers.  Additionally,  we continue to manage these costs
 through more efficient network usage.  These reductions were partially offset by
 $0.8 billion of higher costs due to volume growth,  and $0.3 billion as a result
 of increased per-line charges and Universal Service Fund contributions.

 </TABLE>
 
          Selling,  general and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  decreased $0.2
 billion, or 1.6%, in 2000 compared with 1999.  Approximately $2.0 billion of the
 decrease was due to savings from continued cost-control initiatives and a higher
 pension credit in 2000,  primarily  driven by a higher pension trust asset base,
 resulting from increased  investment  returns.  Largely offsetting this decrease
 was more than  $1.4  billion  of higher  expenses  associated  with our  growing
 wireless  and  broadband  businesses,   and  nearly  $0.7  billion  of  expenses
 associated with  acquisitions and the  consolidation of Excite@Home,  net of the
 impact of Concert and dispositions.
 <PAGE>
 
          SG&A expenses  increased  $0.7 billion,  or 5.8%, in 1999 compared with
 1998.  This  increase was primarily due to  acquisitions,  net of  dispositions,
 which  resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses of  approximately  $1.4 billion.
 Also contributing to the increase was approximately $0.4 billion of higher costs
 to support our growing  wireless  subscriber  base.  Partially  offsetting these
 increases  were our continued  efforts to control costs on a companywide  basis,
 which resulted in lower SG&A expenses of approximately  $0.9 billion,  including
 lower spending for consumer long distance acquisition-programs.

          Depreciation  and other  amortization  expenses rose $1.1  billion,  or
 18.5%, in 2000 compared with 1999 and increased $1.8 billion,  or 40.2%, in 1999
 compared with 1998. Approximately one-half of the increase in both years was due
 to acquisitions and the  consolidation  of Excite@Home,  net of dispositions and
 the impact of Concert,  as applicable.  The remaining increase was primarily due
 to a higher asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment. Total
 capital  expenditures for 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $14.6 billion,  $13.5 billion
 and $8.0  billion,  respectively.  We continue to focus the vast majority of our
 capital spending on our growth  businesses of broadband,  wireless,  data and IP
 and local.

 Excite@Home,  as well as  acquisitions,  primarily  MediaOne and TCI.  Franchise
 costs represent the value attributable to agreements with local authorities that
 allow access to homes in Broadband's service areas. Other purchased  intangibles
 arising from business combinations primarily included customer relationships and
 licenses.
 
          Amortization   of  goodwill,   franchise   costs  and  other  purchased

 Net restructuring and other charges.......................................       $7,029     $1,506     $2,514
 </TABLE>
 <PAGE>
 
          During 2000,  we recorded $7.0 billion of net  restructuring  and other
 charges, which had an approximate $0.90 earnings per diluted share impact to the
 AT&T  Common  Stock  Group.  The 2000  charge  included  $6.2  billion  of asset
 impairment  charges related to Excite@Home,  $759 million for  restructuring and
 exit costs  associated with AT&T's  initiative to reduce costs,  and $91 million
 related to the  government-mandated  disposition of AT&T  Communications  (U.K.)
 Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert.
 
          The asset impairment  charges related to Excite@Home  resulted from the
 deterioration of the market conditions and market valuations of Internet-related
 companies  during  the fourth  quarter  of 2000,  which  caused  Excite@Home  to
 conclude   that   intangible   assets   related   to   their   acquisitions   of
 Internet-related  companies  may not be  recoverable.  Accordingly,  Excite@Home
 conducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of
 acquired  intangible  assets.  This assessment  resulted in a determination that
 certain  acquired  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  related  to  these
 acquisitions,  including  Excite,  were  impaired as of December 31, 2000.  As a
 result,  Excite@Home  recorded  impairment  charges of $4.6  billion in December
 2000, representing the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over
 their fair value.
 
          The  impairment was allocated to each asset group based on a comparison
 of carrying values and fair values. The impairment  write-down within each asset
 group was allocated  first to goodwill,  and if goodwill was reduced to zero, to
 identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values.
 
          Since  we own  approximately  23%  of  Excite@Home,  77% of the  charge
 recorded by  Excite@Home  was not  included as a reduction to AT&T's net income,
 but  rather  was  eliminated  in our 2000  Consolidated  Statement  of Income as
 "Minority interest income (expense)."
 
          Also as a  result  of the  foregoing,  AT&T  recorded  a  goodwill  and
 acquisition-related  impairment  charge  of $1.6  billion  associated  with  the
 acquisition of our investment in  Excite@Home.  The write-down of our investment
 to fair value was determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows.
 
          The $759 million charge for  restructuring and exit plans was primarily
 due to headcount reductions, mainly in network operations and Business Services,
 including  the  consolidation  of  customer-care  and call  centers,  as well as
 synergies created by the MediaOne merger.
 
          Included in exit costs was $503  million of cash  termination  benefits
 associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  7,300  employees as part of
 voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  Approximately  one-half of the
 separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
 Approximately   6,700   employee   separations   were  related  to   involuntary
 terminations and approximately 600 to voluntary terminations.
 
          We also  recorded  $62  million  of  network  lease and other  contract
 termination  costs  associated  with  penalties  incurred  as part of  notifying
 vendors of the termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of
 $32 million related to the disposition of facilities  primarily due to synergies
 created by the MediaOne merger.
 
          Also included in restructuring  and exit costs in 2000 was $144 million
 of benefit plan curtailment  costs associated with employee  separations as part
 of these exit plans.  Further,  we recorded  an asset  impairment  charge of $18
 million related to the write-down of unrecoverable  assets in certain businesses
 where the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.
 <PAGE>
 
          The 2000 restructuring  initiatives are projected to yield cash savings
 of  approximately  $690  million  per  year,  as well as EBIT  (earnings  before
 interest and taxes,  including  pretax  minority  interest and net pretax losses
 from other equity  investments)  savings of approximately $700 million per year.
 We expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cash
 and  EBIT  savings.  The  EBIT  savings,   primarily   attributable  to  reduced
 personnel-related  expenses,  will be  realized  in SG&A  expenses  and costs of
 services and products.
 
          During 1999,  we recorded $1.5 billion of net  restructuring  and other
 charges, which had an approximate $0.37 earnings per diluted share impact to the
 AT&T Common Stock Group.
 
          A $594 million in-process  research and development charge was recorded
 reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at TCI,
 as of the  date of the  acquisition,  which  had not yet  reached  technological
 feasibility or had no alternative future use. The projects identified related to
 efforts to offer voice over IP, product-integration efforts for advanced set-top
 devices,  cost-savings  efforts  for  broadband-telephony   implementation,  and
 in-process  research and development  related to  Excite@Home.  We estimated the
 fair value of  in-process  research and  development  for each project  using an
 income  approach,  which  was  adjusted  to  allocate  fair  value  based on the
 project's  percentage of completion.  Under this approach,  the present value of
 the anticipated  future benefits of the projects was determined using a discount
 rate of 17%. For each project, the resulting net present value was multiplied by
 a percentage of  completion  based on effort  expended to date versus  projected
 costs to complete.
 
          The charge associated with voice-over-IP technology, which allows voice
 telephony  traffic to be digitized and transmitted in IP data packets,  was $225
 million as of the date of acquisition.  Current voice-over-IP equipment does not
 yet support many of the features required to connect customer premises equipment
 to traditional phone networks.  Further technical  development is also needed to
 ensure  voice  quality  that  is  comparable  to  conventional  circuit-switched
 telephony and to reduce the power consumption of the IP-telephony  equipment. We
 started  testing  IP-telephony  equipment  in the  field in  late-2000  and will
 continue tests throughout 2001.
 
          The charge  associated  with  product-integration  efforts for advanced
 set-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,
 was $114 million as of the acquisition date. The associated  technology consists
 of the development  and  integration  work needed to provide a suite of software
 tools to run on the digital  set-top box hardware  platform.  It is  anticipated
 that field trials will begin in late-2001 for next-generation digital services.
 
          The charge associated with cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephony
 implementation  was $101 million as of the date of  acquisition.  Telephony cost
 reductions  primarily consist of cost savings from the development of a "line of
 power  switch," which allows us to cost  effectively  provide power for customer
 telephony  equipment  through  the cable  plant.  This  device  will allow us to
 provide  line-powered  telephony  without  burying the cable line to each house.
 Trials related to our telephony cost reductions are complete, and implementation
 has begun in certain markets.
 
          Additionally, the in-process research and development charge related to
 Excite@Home was valued at $154 million. This charge related to projects to allow
 for  self-provisioning of devices and the development of next-generation  client
 software,  network and back-office infrastructure to enable a variety of network
 devices  beyond  personal  computers  and improved  design for the regional data
 centers' infrastructure.
 <PAGE>
 
          Although  there are  technological  issues to overcome to  successfully
 complete the acquired in-process research and development,  we expect successful
 completion.  We estimate the costs to complete the identified  projects will not
 have a material impact on our results of operations.  If, however, we are unable
 to  establish   technological   feasibility  and  produce   commercially  viable
 products/services,  anticipated  incremental  future cash flows  attributable to
 expected profits from such new products/services may not be realized.
 
          A $531 million asset impairment  charge was recorded in 1999 associated
 with the planned disposal of certain wireless communications equipment resulting
 from a program to increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our wireless
 network.  As part of a multivendor  program,  contracts  have been executed with
 select vendors to replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure
 equipment in the western  United States and the  metropolitan  New York markets.
 The program is intended to provide Wireless  Services with the newest technology
 available  and allow us to evolve to new,  next-generation  digital  technology,
 which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities. Since the assets will
 remain in service  from the date of the  decision to dispose of these  assets to
 the  disposal  date,  the  remaining  net  book  value  of the  assets  will  be
 depreciated over this period.
 
          Also in 1999, a $145 million  charge for  restructuring  and exit costs
 was recorded as part of AT&T's initiative to reduce costs. The restructuring and
 exit plans primarily  focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount
 reductions  in  Business   Services  and  network   operations,   including  the
 consolidation of customer-care and call centers.
 
          Included in exit costs was $142  million of cash  termination  benefits
 associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of
 voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  Approximately  one-half of the
 separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
 Approximately   1,700   employee   separations   were  related  to   involuntary
 terminations and approximately 1,100 to voluntary terminations.
 
          The 1999 restructuring  initiatives are projected to yield cash savings
 of approximately $250 million per year. This restructuring  yielded EBIT savings
 of  approximately  $200  million in 2000,  and is  expected  to save nearly $400
 million per year thereafter.  We expect increased  spending in growth businesses
 will largely  offset these cash and EBIT savings.  The EBIT  savings,  primarily
 attributable  to reduced  personnel-related  expenses,  will be realized in SG&A
 expenses and costs of services and products.
 
          We  also   recorded  net  losses  of  $307   million   related  to  the
 government-mandated  disposition of certain international  businesses that would
 have competed  directly with Concert,  and $50 million related to a contribution
 agreement Broadband entered into with Phoenixstar,  Inc. That agreement requires
 Broadband  to  satisfy   certain   liabilities   owed  by  Phoenixstar  and  its
 subsidiaries.  The remaining obligation under this contribution agreement and an
 agreement  that  MediaOne  had is $57  million,  which was fully  accrued for at
 December 31, 2000. In addition,  we recorded benefits of $121 million related to
 the settlement of pension  obligations for former  employees who accepted AT&T's
 1998 voluntary retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer.
 
          During 1998,  we recorded $2.5 billion of net  restructuring  and other
 charges, which had an approximate $0.59 earnings per diluted share impact to the
 AT&T Common Stock Group.  The bulk of the charge was associated with our overall
 cost-reduction  program and the approximately  15,300  management  employees who
 accepted the VRIP offer. A  restructuring  charge of $2,724 million was composed
 
 <PAGE>
 
 of  $2,254   million  and  $169   million   for   pension   and   postretirement
 special-termination  benefits,   respectively,  $263  million  of  benefit  plan
 curtailment  losses  and $38  million  of other  administrative  costs.  We also
 recorded charges of $125 million for related facility costs and $150 million for
 executive-separation  costs.  These charges were partially offset by benefits of
 $940 million as we settled pension  benefit  obligations for 13,700 of the total
 VRIP  employees.  In addition,  the VRIP charges  were  partially  offset by the
 reversal  of $256  million of 1995  business  restructuring  reserves  primarily
 resulting from the overlap of VRIP on certain 1995 projects.
 
          Also  included in the 1998 net  restructuring  and other  charges  were
 asset  impairment  charges  totaling  $718  million,  of which $633  million was
 related  to  our  decision  not  to  pursue  Total  Service  Resale  (TSR)  as a
 local-service  strategy. We also recorded an $85 million asset impairment charge
 related to the  write-down  of  unrecoverable  assets in  certain  international
 operations  where the  carrying  value was no longer  supported  by future  cash
 flows. This charge was made in connection with the review of certain  operations
 that would have competed directly with Concert.
 
          Additionally,  $85 million of merger-related  expenses were recorded in
 1998 in connection  with the Teleport  Communications  Group Inc.  (TCG) merger,
 which was accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Partially  offsetting  these
 charges  was a $92  million  reversal of the 1995  restructuring  reserve.  This
 reversal reflected  reserves no longer deemed necessary.  The reversal primarily
 included  separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower than
 originally   anticipated.   Consistent  with  the  three-year   plan,  the  1995
 restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 1998.

 Operating income.........................................................       $4,277     $10,859     $7,487
 </TABLE>
 
          Operating  income  decreased $6.6 billion,  or 60.6%,  in 2000 compared
 with 1999. The decrease was primarily due to higher net  restructuring and other
 charges of $5.5 billion. Also contributing to the decrease was the impact of the
 acquisition  of MediaOne and the  consolidation  of  Excite@Home,  which lowered
 operating  income by $1.5 billion.  A majority of the impact of operating losses
 and the  restructuring  charge  generated by Excite@Home  was offset in minority
 interest income  (expense),  reflecting the approximate 77% of Excite@Home we do
 not own. Partially offsetting these decreases were cost-control  initiatives and
 a larger pension credit associated with our mature long distance  businesses and
 related support groups, partially offset by lower long distance revenue.
 
          Operating  income rose $3.4  billion,  or 45.0%,  in 1999 compared with
 1998. The increase was driven by approximately  $2.3 billion of operating income
 improvements in Business Services and Consumer  Services,  reflecting  operating
 expense  efficiencies.  Also  contributing  to the  increase was $1.0 billion of
 lower net restructuring and other charges.

          Other income  increased $0.6 billion,  or 62.4%,  in 2000 compared with
 1999.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to  greater  net  gains  on  sales of
 businesses  and   investments  of   approximately   $1.0  billion,   and  higher
 investment-related  income of  approximately  $0.3 billion.  The higher gains on
 sales  were  driven  by  significant  gains  associated  with  the swap of cable
 properties  with Comcast  Corporation  (Comcast)  and Cox  Communications,  Inc.
 (Cox), the sale of our investment in Lenfest Communications,  Inc. (Lenfest) and
 Celumovil,  and a gain  recorded as a result of the merger of TeleCorp PCS, Inc.
 (TeleCorp)  and Tritel,  Inc.  (Tritel)  and related  transactions.  These gains
 aggregated  approximately $1.0 billion and had an approximate $0.29 earnings per
 diluted  share  impact to the AT&T  Common  Stock  Group.  In 1999,  we recorded
 significant  gains  associated  with  the  sale of our  Language  Line  Services
 business,  a portion of our  ownership  interest  in AT&T  Canada as well as our
 investment in Wood-TV. These gains aggregated approximately $0.4 billion and had
 an approximate  $0.07 earnings per diluted share impact to the AT&T Common Stock
 Group.  Offsetting the increases to other income in 2000 was an approximate $0.5
 billion charge  reflecting the increase in the fair value of put options held by
 Comcast and Cox related to Excite@Home  stock, and approximately $0.2 billion of
 higher investment impairment charges.
 
          Other income  decreased $0.4 billion,  or 27.3%,  in 1999 compared with
 1998.  The  decrease  was due to lower  net  gains on  sales of  businesses  and
 investments of  approximately  $0.3 billion as well as lower  investment-related
 income of approximately  $0.2 billion.  In 1999, we recorded  significant  gains
 associated  with the sale of our Language Line Services  business,  a portion of
 our  ownership  interest  in AT&T Canada as well as our  investment  in Wood-TV.
 These gains aggregated  approximately  $0.4 billion and had an approximate $0.07
 earnings per diluted  share impact to the AT&T Common Stock Group.  In 1998,  we
 recorded  significant gains associated with the sale of AT&T Solutions  Customer
 Care, LIN Television  Corp. and SmarTone  Telecommunications  Holdings  Limited.
 These gains aggregated  approximately  $0.8 billion and had an approximate $0.18
 earnings per diluted share impact to the AT&T Common Stock Group.

          Interest  expense  increased  80.3%, or $1.4 billion,  in 2000 compared
 with 1999.  The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance as a
 result of our June 2000 acquisition of MediaOne,  including  outstanding debt of
 MediaOne  and debt issued to fund the MediaOne  acquisition,  and our March 1999
 acquisition of TCI, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.
 
          Interest expense increased $1.3 billion in 1999 compared with 1998, due
 to a higher average debt balance  associated  with our  acquisitions,  including
 debt outstanding of TCI at the date of acquisition.

 Provision for income taxes................................................       $3,342     $3,695     $3,049
 </TABLE>
 <PAGE>
 
          The  effective  income tax rate is the  provision for income taxes as a
 percent of income from continuing  operations before income taxes. The effective
 income  tax rate was 128.1% in 2000,  36.9% in 1999 and 36.6% in 1998.  In 2000,
 the effective tax rate was negatively  impacted by Excite@Home,  which is unable
 to record tax benefits  associated  with its pretax  losses.  Therefore the $4.6
 billion restructuring charges taken by Excite@Home in 2000 had no associated tax
 benefit.  The 2000 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax-free gain
 resulting  from an exchange  of AT&T stock for an entity  owning  certain  cable
 systems  and other  assets  with Cox and the  benefit  of the  write-off  of the
 related  deferred tax  liability.  The 1999  effective  tax rate was  negatively
 impacted by a non-tax-deductible research and development charge, but positively
 impacted  by a change in the net  operating  loss  utilization  tax  rules  that
 resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance and the income tax provision.

 Minority interest income (expense)...........................................       $4,120     $(115)     $21
 </TABLE>
 
          Minority  interest  income  (expense),  which is recorded net of income
 taxes,  represents  an adjustment to AT&T's income to reflect the less than 100%
 ownership of  consolidated  subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
 issued by subsidiaries of AT&T. The $4.2 billion  increase in minority  interest
 in 2000 resulted from the  consolidation of Excite@Home  effective  September 1,
 2000. The minority  interest income in 2000 primarily  reflects losses generated
 by Excite@Home, including the goodwill impairment charge, that were attributable
 to the  approximate  77% of  Excite@Home  not  owned by AT&T.  The  decrease  in
 minority  interest in 1999  compared with 1998 was primarily due to dividends on
 preferred securities issued by a subsidiary trust of AT&T in 1999.

          Equity earnings from LMG, which are recorded net of income taxes,  were
 $1.5 billion in 2000, compared with losses of $2.0 billion in 1999. The increase
 was primarily due to gains on dispositions,  including gains associated with the
 mergers of various  companies that LMG had  investments  in. Gains were recorded
 for the difference  between the carrying value of LMG's interest in the acquired
 company and the fair value of  securities  received in the merger.  In addition,
 lower stock  compensation  expense in 2000 compared with 1999 contributed to the
 increase.  These were partially  offset by impairment  charges recorded on LMG's
 investments to reflect other than temporary  declines in value and higher losses
 relating to LMG's equity affiliates.

          Net losses from other  equity  investments,  which are  recorded net of
 income taxes, were $0.2 billion in 2000, a 73.2% improvement compared with 1999.
 This  improvement  was primarily a result of the redemption of our investment in
 AB Cellular which resulted in the distribution of wireless properties in the Los
 Angeles  area  to  AT&T,  which  caused  AB  Cellular  to  record  a gain on the
 distribution. Our pro rata share of this gain was approximately $0.4 billion. In
 addition,  in 2000,  earnings from our investment in  Cablevision  Systems Corp.
 (Cablevision) were approximately $0.2 billion higher than 1999 due to gains from
 cable-system  sales.  Offsetting  these  increases were losses from our stake in
 Time Warner  Entertainment  Company,  L.P. (TWE) which we acquired in connection
 with the  MediaOne  merger and greater  equity  losses from  Excite@Home,  which
 aggregated approximately $0.1 billion.
 
          Net losses from equity  investments  were $0.8 billion in 1999 compared
 with $78 million in 1998,  primarily due to losses we recorded on investments we
 acquired through TCI, largely Cablevision and Excite@Home.

          Earnings per diluted share (EPS)  attributable to the AT&T Common Stock
 Group were $0.88 in 2000 compared  with $1.74 in 1999, a decrease of 49.4%.  The
 decrease was primarily due to higher  restructuring and asset impairment charges
 and the MediaOne acquisition,  including the impact of shares issued,  operating
 losses of MediaOne and additional  interest  expense.  Also  contributing to the
 decrease was the impact of Excite@Home,  including the mark-to-market adjustment
 related to the put options held by Comcast and Cox. These were partially  offset
 by lower  losses  from  equity  investments  and an  increase  in other  income,
 primarily   associated  with  higher  net  gains  on  sales  of  businesses  and
 investments, and higher investment-related income. Also impacting EPS was higher
 operating income associated with our mature long distance businesses.
 
          EPS from  continuing  operations  attributable to the AT&T Common Stock
 Group on a diluted basis declined  10.3% in 1999, to $1.74,  compared with 1998.
 The decline was  primarily  due to the impact of the TCI and AGNS  acquisitions,
 including  the  impact of shares  issued and equity  losses of  Excite@Home  and
 Cablevision.  Partially offsetting these declines were increased income from the
 remaining  operations due to revenue growth and operating expense  efficiencies,
 as well as lower net restructuring and other charges.
 <PAGE>
 
          EPS for Liberty Media Group was $0.58 in 2000,  compared with a loss of
 $0.80 per share for 1999.  The  increase  in EPS was  primarily  due to gains on
 dispositions,  including gains associated with the mergers of various  companies
 that LMG had investments in. Gains were recorded for the difference  between the
 carrying value of LMG's  interest in the acquired  company and the fair value of
 securities received in the merger. In addition, lower stock compensation expense
 in 2000 compared with 1999  contributed  to the increase.  These were  partially
 offset by impairment charges recorded on LMG's investments to reflect other than
 temporary  declines  in  value  and  higher  losses  relating  to  LMG's  equity
 affiliates.
 
 Discontinued Operations
 
          Pursuant to Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the
 Results  of  Operations--Reporting  the  Effects of  Disposal  of a Segment of a
 Business,  and  Extraordinary,  Unusual and  Infrequently  Occurring  Events and
 Transactions,"  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  AT&T  reflect  the
 disposition of AT&T Universal  Card Services  (UCS),  which was sold on April 2,
 1998, as discontinued operations.  Accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses,
 and cash flows of UCS have been  excluded  from the  respective  captions in the
 1998 Consolidated  Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
 and have been reported  through the April 2, 1998 date of disposition as "Income
 from discontinued  operations," net of applicable income taxes; and as "Net cash
 provided by discontinued  operations."  The gain associated with the sale of UCS
 is  recorded as "Gain on sale of  discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable
 income taxes.
 
 Extraordinary Items
 
          In August 1998, AT&T extinguished  approximately  $1.0 billion of TCG's
 debt.  The $217  million  pretax  loss on the early  extinguishment  of debt was
 recorded as an  extraordinary  loss. The after-tax  impact was $137 million,  or
 $0.05 per diluted share.
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS
 
          In support of the services we provided in 2000,  we segment our results
 by the  business  units that  support our primary  lines of  business:  Business
 Services,  Consumer  Services,  Wireless Services and Broadband.  The balance of
 AT&T's operations, excluding LMG, is included in a Corporate and Other category.
 Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG.
 
          The  discussion of segment  results  includes  revenue;  EBIT (earnings
 before interest and taxes,  including  pretax  minority  interest and net pretax
 losses  of  other  equity   investments);   EBITDA   (EBIT  plus   depreciation,
 amortization  and minority  interest income  (expense) other than  Excite@Home);
 total  assets,  and capital  additions.  The  discussion  of EBITDA for Wireless
 Services and  Broadband is modified to exclude  other income and net losses from
 equity investments.  Total assets for each segment generally include all assets,
 except intercompany receivables. However, our Wireless Services segment included
 intercompany  receivables  from AT&T and the related interest income since these
 assets  relate to the  results  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracked  business.
 Prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally
 held at the  corporate  level,  and  therefore are included in the Corporate and
 Other group. Shared network assets are allocated to the segments and reallocated
 each January, based on two years of volumes.  Capital additions for each segment
 include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,  acquisitions of
 licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
 and additions to internal-use software.
 <PAGE>
 
          EBIT is the primary  measure  used by AT&T's chief  operating  decision
 makers to measure AT&T's operating results and to measure segment  profitability
 and performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus net pretax losses
 from equity  investments,  pretax minority  interest income  (expense) and other
 income.  In  addition,  management  also uses  EBITDA as a  measure  of  segment
 profitability  and  performance,  and is  defined  as EBIT,  excluding  minority
 interest  income  (expense)  other  than  Excite@Home,   plus  depreciation  and
 amortization. Interest and taxes are not factored into the segment profitability
 measure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for these
 items  are  discussed  on a  consolidated  basis.  Management  believes  EBIT is
 meaningful to investors  because it provides analysis of operating results using
 the same measures used by AT&T's chief operating  decision makers and provides a
 return on total  capitalization  measure.  We believe  EBITDA is  meaningful  to
 investors as a measure of each segment's  liquidity  consistent with the measure
 utilized by our chief operating  decision makers.  In addition,  we believe that
 both EBIT and EBITDA allow  investors a means to evaluate the financial  results
 of each segment in relation to total AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was $9.4 billion, $10.5
 billion and $8.7 billion for the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998,
 respectively. EBITDA for AT&T was $19.8 billion, $18.6 billion and $13.4 billion
 for the  years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  Our
 calculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation
 of these  measures  by other  public  companies.  EBIT and EBITDA  should not be
 viewed  by  investors  as  an  alternative  to  generally  accepted   accounting
 principles  (GAAP)  measures  of income as a measure of  performance  or to cash
 flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
 liquidity.  In addition,  EBITDA does not take into  account  changes in certain
 assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow.
 
          Reflecting  the dynamics of our  business,  we  continually  review our
 management model and structure and make adjustments accordingly.
 
 BUSINESS SERVICES
 
          Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications
 services,  including long distance,  local,  and data and IP networking to small
 and medium-sized  businesses,  large domestic and  multinational  businesses and
 government agencies.  Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IP
 transport to service resellers (wholesale services).
 
          Business    Services    includes   AT&T   Solutions,    the   company's
 professional-services  outsourcing  business,  which provides seamless solutions
 that  maximize  the  competitive   advantage  of   networking-based   electronic
 applications for global clients.  AT&T Solutions also provides  e-infrastructure
 and high-availability services to enterprise clients, and manages AT&T's unified
 global network.

 REVENUE
 
          In 2000, Business Services revenue grew $1.0 billion, or 3.7%, compared
 with 1999.  Approximately  $0.4 billion of the increase was due to the impact of
 acquisitions, partially offset by the formation of Concert. Strength in data and
 IP  services  as well as growth in our  outsourcing  business  contributed  $1.8
 billion to the increase. This growth, however, was offset by an approximate $0.9
 billion decline in long distance voice services as a result of continued pricing
 pressures in the industry.
 
          Revenue in 1999 grew $3.2 billion,  or 13.2%.  The  acquisition of AGNS
 contributed  approximately $1.1 billion to the growth.  Data, IP and outsourcing
 services grew  approximately $1.5 billion in 1999 compared with 1998, while long
 distance  voice  services  and local  services  contributed  approximately  $0.6
 billion to the revenue increase.
 
          Data services,  which represent the transportation of data, rather than
 voice,  along our network,  was impacted by  acquisitions  and the  formation of
 Concert.  Excluding these impacts, data services grew at a high-teens percentage
 rate in 2000. Growth was led by the continued  strength of frame relay services;
 IP services,  which include IP-connectivity services and virtual private network
 (VPN) services; and high-speed  private-line  services.  Excluding the impact of
 AGNS,  data  services  grew at a  high-teens  percentage  rate in  1999,  led by
 strength in frame relay and high-speed private-line services.
 
          AT&T  Solutions  outsourcing  revenue  grew 47.9% in 2000 and 146.0% in
 1999.  More than one-half of the 2000 growth and  approximately  65% of the 1999
 growth was driven by our acquisition of AGNS. The remaining growth in both years
 was primarily due to growth from new contract  signings and add-on business from
 existing clients.
 
          Excluding the impact of Concert,  long distance voice services  revenue
 declined  at a mid  single-digit  percentage  rate  in 2000  due to a  declining
 average price per minute  reflecting the competitive  forces within the industry
 which are expected to  continue.  Partially  offsetting  this decline was a high
 single-digit  percentage  growth rate in minutes.  In 1999,  long distance voice
 revenue  grew  at a low  single-digit  percentage  rate,  as  volumes  grew at a
 high-teens percentage rate, which was largely offset by a declining average rate
 per minute.
 
          Local voice services  revenue grew nearly 20% in 2000 and more than 50%
 in 1999.  During 2000, AT&T added more than 867,000 access lines, with the total
 reaching nearly 2.3 million at the end of the year. During 1999, AT&T added more
 than 719,000 access lines.  Access lines enable AT&T to provide local service to
 customers by allowing  direct  connection  from  customer  equipment to the AT&T
 network.  AT&T serves more than 6,000 buildings on-network (buildings where AT&T
 owns the  fiber  that runs  into the  building),  representing  an  increase  of
 approximately  3.5% over 1999.  At the end of 1999,  AT&T served just over 5,800
 buildings  on-network  compared with approximately 5,200 buildings at the end of
 1998.
 
          Business Services  internal revenue increased $66 million,  or 9.1%, in
 2000 and $253 million, or 52.8%, in 1999. The increase in 2000 was the result of
 greater sales of business long distance services to other AT&T units that resell
 such  services to their  external  customers,  primarily  Broadband and Wireless
 Services.  The  increase  in 2000 was  partially  offset by a  decline  in sales
 related to international  businesses divested. In 1999, the increase in internal
 revenue was primarily due to greater sales of long distance services to Wireless
 Services.

 EBIT/EBITDA
 
          EBIT improved $0.4 billion,  or 6.7%, and EBITDA improved $0.8 billion,
 or 8.1%, in 2000 compared with 1999.  This  improvement  reflects an increase in
 revenue  and lower  costs as a result  of our  continued  cost-control  efforts,
 partially  offset by the  formation  of  Concert  and the  acquisition  of AGNS.
 Additionally,  the  EBIT  increase  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in
 depreciation and  amortization  expense in 2000 compared with 1999 primarily due
 to a higher network asset base.
 
          In 1999, EBIT improved $1.1 billion, or 22.9%, and EBITDA improved $1.9
 billion,  or 25.7%,  compared with 1998.  These increases were driven by revenue
 growth  combined with margin  improvement  resulting  from ongoing  cost-control
 initiatives.  The increase in EBIT was offset somewhat by increased depreciation
 and amortization expenses resulting from increased capital expenditures aimed at
 data, IP and local services.
