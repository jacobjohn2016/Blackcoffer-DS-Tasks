 OF OPERATIONS
  
 OVERVIEW
  
      The Company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of nationally branded
 and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in the $60
 billion to $70 billion North American office products industry. The Company
 offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, file folders,
 envelopes and other paper-based products. Through its Ampad division, the
 Company is among the largest suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing
 products, filing supplies and retail envelopes to many of the largest and
 fastest growing office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division,
 the Company is the leading supplier of mill branded specialty and commodity
 business envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes
 that its future operating results will not be directly comparable to its
 historical operating results because of its strategic acquisitions. Certain
 factors, which have affected, and may affect prospectively, the operating
 results of the Company are discussed below.
  
      Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been accounted
 for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have currently
 affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of operations in
 certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs (including
 assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair
 market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase price result in
 an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such as property,
 plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, which results in
 incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each year.
  
      Raw Material. The Company's principal raw material is paper. Certain
 commodity grades utilized by the Company have shown considerable price
 volatility since 1992. From May 1997 through October 1997, all but one of the
 key commodity grades of paper utilized by the Company increased in cost between
 6% and 18%. Due to strategic customer considerations and competitive market
 conditions, the Company did not begin to recover a significant portion of the
 increases in paper costs affecting both its divisions until December 1997. The
 Company continued to implement sales price increases during the first half of
 1998. Since October 1997, the key commodity grades of paper utilized by the
 Company decreased in cost between 6% and 18%. Paper price volatility is expected
 to continue to have an effect on net sales and cost of sales and there is no
 assurance that the Company will not be materially affected by future
 fluctuations in the price of paper. Fluctuations in paper prices can have an
 effect on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations and financial
 condition of the Company.
  
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
  
      Management Changes. The Company appointed James W. Swent, III as Executive
 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and David N. Pilotte as Vice
 President and Corporate Controller on June 2 and 10, respectively. Mr. Swent was
 previously Chief Executive Officer of Cyrix Corporation, a manufacturer of
 microprocessors for the PC industry, until its merger with National
 Semiconductor. In addition, he has held operations and financial executive
 positions with a number of companies, including Northern Telecom, Rodime PLC and
 Memorex. On July 8, 1998 the Company appointed Mr. Swent as Chief Executive
 Officer and a member of its Board of Directors ("Board"). Mr. Swent replaced
 Charles G. Hanson who retired from his position as Chairman and Chief Executive
 Officer and director of the Company. Robert C. Gay, who had been a director of
 American Pad & Paper since 1992 and who is a Managing Director of Bain Capital,
 Inc., became Chairman of the Board. In addition, Paul B. Edgerly, a Managing
 Director of Bain Capital, was added to the Board, increasing the Board size to
 nine members. Also, Russel M. Gard stepped down as President and Chief Operating
 Officer, but will continue his duties as Vice Chairman and a member of the
 Board. Timothy E. Needham, who joined the Company in 1995 following the
 acquisition of Williamhouse, was promoted to President and Chief Operating
 Officer. On July 20, 1998, the Company appointed William L. Morgan as Executive
 Vice President, Operations. Mr. Morgan has 35 years of progressive manufacturing
 experience ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to large scale multi-national
 corporations including Northern Telecom, Texas Instruments, Memorex and Fujitsu.

      Company Initiatives/Restructuring. Under the leadership of new management,
 the Company has begun a review of all operations with the challenge of
 rebuilding market share, reducing debt and returning the Company to
 profitability. On July 15, 1998, the Board approved the Company's exit from the
 forms business in its current form which has produced unfavorable margins. As
 part of the review process, the Company retained the management consulting firm
 of Bain & Company and the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company to
 assist the Company in evaluating its current position in the marketplace and in
 setting the Company's long term strategic direction. Goldman Sachs will explore
 external strategic and financial alternatives to maximize shareholder value.
 Bain & Company will work closely with the Company's customers and suppliers to
 evaluate core strengths and identify opportunities for improvement. They will
 also assist the Company to restructure manufacturing to best serve each of the
 Company's markets. Significant restructuring charges are expected for the three
 months ending September 30, 1998.
  
      Covenant Violations/Negotiation to Modify Agreement. As a result of the
 second quarter loss, the Company was in default of certain covenants based on
 EBITDA levels at June 30, 1998. On June 30, 1998 the Company obtained an
 amendment to its credit agreement waiving all defaults of its financial
 covenants through July 31, 1998. On July 24, 1998, the waiver was extended
 through September 30, 1998. The extension also amends the credit agreement to
 provide for: changes in the voting procedures necessary to access the additional
 $30.0 million available under the credit line and fees of $.3 million to be paid
 to those banks approving the extension. The Company's banking group has not
 accelerated the debt under the bank credit agreement. However, the Company will
 be unable to meet the EBITDA covenants for September 30, 1998 in the current
 bank credit agreement, and it is unlikely that the Company will meet such
 existing EBITDA covenants for future measurement dates. As a result, $286,900 of
 the Company's long-term debt has been reclassified as current portion of
 long-term debt at June 30, 1998 as required by EITF 86-30. The Company is
 currently in negotiations with its bank group to obtain a permanent amendment to
 its bank credit agreement with attainable EBITDA and other covenants. While the
 Company cannot predict with assurance the outcome of such negotiations, the
 Company expects to obtain such a permanent amendment to its bank credit
 agreement. Once such a permanent amendment is obtained, the Company's bank debt
 will be reclassified to long-term debt on the balance sheet.

 THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997
  
      Net Sales for the three months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $20.5
 million, or 12.3%, to $146.7 million from $167.2 million for the three months
 ended June 30, 1997. This net sales decrease is comprised of a $11.0 million
 reduction in sales spread evenly among continuous forms, envelopes and writing
 products and a $9.5 million increase in customer incentives. The lower sales are
 due to lower volumes caused by temporarily reduced orders resulting from major
 customer inventory reductions, partially offset by higher prices. The increased
 customer incentives are due to a changing product mix and additional rebate
 programs caused by more competitive pricing.
  
      Gross Profit for the three months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $27.3
 million, or 88.9%, to $3.4 million from $30.7 million for the three months ended
 June 30, 1997. Gross profit margin decreased to 2.3% for the three months ended
 June 30, 1998 from 18.4% for the three months ended June 30, 1997. The decrease
 in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to higher unit production costs
 due to underutilized capacity resulting from the Company's efforts to reduce its
 inventory, a reduction in selling margins due to competitive pricing pressures,
 and a change in product mix, particularly the ongoing sales of continuous forms
 at unfavorable margins. In addition, the second quarter of 1998 includes
 approximately $7.5 million of charges resulting from reevaluating certain
 inventories based on changes in current market conditions and accruals for
 workers' compensation and property tax.

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- (CONTINUED)
  
      Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 1998
 increased to $5.5 million, or 3.8% of sales from $5.2 million or 3.1% for the
 three months ended June 30, 1997. The increase of $0.3 million was comprised
 primarily of severance costs.
  
      General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30,
 1998 increased to $9.3 million from $3.4 million for the three months ended June
 30, 1997, an increase of $5.9 million. This increase is primarily attributable
 to the Company's reevaluation of certain assets, which resulted in $1.7 million
 of current charges for additional allowance for doubtful accounts stemming from
 customer deductions and one time severance costs and litigation costs of $1.3
 million. The remainder of the increase is attributable to one time charges
 associated with centralizing certain functions in Dallas.
  
      Losses on sales of accounts receivable for the three months ended June 30,
 1998 increased to $0.7 million from $0.6 million for the three months ended June
 30, 1997 due to a higher average level of accounts receivable sold to the third
 party trust in the first half of 1998, partially offset by a slightly lower
 average effective interest rate.
  
      Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense for the three months
 ended June 30, 1998 increased to $1.6 million from $1.5 million for the three
 months ended June 30, 1997, an increase of $0.1 million.
  
      Write-down of Intangible Assets expense of $41.0 million for the three
 months ended June 30, 1998 reflects a write-off of goodwill and a write-down of
 intangible assets associated with the Shade/Allied continuous forms business
 resulting from the Company's decision to exit the forms business in its current
 form.
  
      Management fees and services expense for the three months ended June 30,
 1998 amounted to $0.5 million as compared to $1.8 million for the three months
 ended June 30, 1997. The change in management fees is due primarily to a one
 year non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara,
 which expired June 30, 1997.
  
      Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 1998 increased to
 $11.1 million from $9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 1997, an
 increase of $1.5 million. Of this increase, $0.7 million is attributable to
 increased debt levels, $0.4 million is attributable to increased interest rates
 and $0.4 million is attributable to the amortization of fees paid in connection
 with amendments to the credit agreement obtained in February 1998 and other
 costs.
  
      The income tax provision for the three month period ended June 30, 1998
 reflects an effective tax rate of 15.7% versus an effective tax rate of 45.0%
 for the three month period ended June 30, 1997. Due to the expected effect of
 nondeductible expenses during 1998, primarily goodwill amortization, the Company
 lowered its effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 1998 to an annual
 effective rate of 17.8%.
  
 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997
  
      Net Sales for the six months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $8.7 million,
 or 2.7%, to $308.3 million from $317.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
 1997. This net sales decrease is comprised of a $4.2 million increase in sales
 offset by a $12.6 million increase in customer incentives and a $0.3 million
 increase in cash discounts. The net sales increase, is primarily attributable
 ($3.3 million) to owning Shade/ Allied for the full first half of 1998 versus
 only four and a half months in the same period in 1997. The increased customer
 incentives are due to a changing product mix and additional rebate programs
 caused by more competitive pricing.
  
      Gross Profit for the six months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $36.6
 million, or 61.6%, to $22.8 million from $59.4 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 1997. Gross profit margin decreased to 7.4% for the six months ended
 June 30, 1998 from 18.7% for the six months ended June 30, 1997. The

 decrease in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to higher unit
 production costs due to underutilized capacity resulting from the Company's
 efforts to reduce its inventory, a reduction in selling margins due to
 competitive pricing pressures, and a change in product mix, particularly the
 ongoing sales of continuous forms at unfavorable margins. In addition, the
 second half of 1998 includes approximately $7.5 million of charges resulting
 from reevaluating certain inventories based on changes in current market
 conditions and accruals for workers' compensation and property tax.
  
      Selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 1998
 increased to $10.2 million, or 3.3% of sales, from $9.8 million, or 3.1% of
 sales, for the six months ended June 30, 1997. The increase of $0.4 million, or
 0.1% of sales was comprised primarily of severance costs.
  
      General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 1998
 increased to $14.7 million from $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
 1997, an increase of $6.5 million. This increase is primarily attributable to
 the Company's reevaluation of certain assets which resulted in $1.7 million of
 current charges for additional allowance for doubtful accounts stemming from
 customer deductions and one time severance and litigation costs of $1.3 million.
 Of the remainder of the increase, $0.1 million is attributable to owning
 Shade/Allied for the full first half of 1998 versus only four and a half months
 in the same period in 1997 and one time charges associated with centralizing
 certain functions in Dallas.
  
      Losses on sales of accounts receivable for the six months ended June 30,
 1998 increased to $1.5 million from $1.4 million for the six months ended June
 30, 1997 due to a higher average interest rate, partially offset by a lower
 average level of accounts receivable sold to the third party trust in the first
 half of 1998.
  
      Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense for the six months ended
 June 30, 1998 increased to $3.2 million from $2.9 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 1997, an increase of $0.3 million, due primarily to six months
 amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Shade/Allied for the
 six months ended June 30, 1998 as compared to four and a half months for the six
 months ended June 30, 1997.
  
      Write-down of Intangible Assets expense of $41.0 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 1998 reflects a write-off of goodwill and a write-down of
 intangible assets associated with the Shade/Allied continuous forms business
 resulting from the Company's decision to exit the forms business in its current
 form.
  
      Management fees and services expense for the six months ended June 30, 1998
 amounted to $1.1 million as compared to $3.7 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 1997. The change in management fees is due primarily to a one-year
 non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara, which
 expired June 30, 1997.
  
      Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 1998 increased to $21.8
 million from $17.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 1997, an increase
 of $4.0 million. Of this increase, $2.6 million is attributable to increased
 debt levels, $0.9 million is attributable to increased interest rates and $0.5
 million is attributable to amortization of fees paid in connection with
 amendments to the credit agreement obtained in February 1998 and other costs.
  
      The income tax provision for the six month period ended June 30, 1998
 reflects an effective tax rate of 17.8% versus an effective tax rate of 45.0%
 for the six month period ended June 30, 1997. Due to the expected effect of
 nondeductible expenses during 1998, primarily goodwill amortization, the Company
 lowered its effective income tax rate in 1998.
  
 KNOWN TRENDS AND SEASONALITY
  
      The Company does experience some seasonality in its business operations.
 During the Company's third and fourth quarters, net sales tend to be higher than
 in the first and second quarters due to higher product sales of back-to-school,
 seasonal greeting card and tax filing products.

      The Company's Ampad division sells primarily to fast growing customers such
 as office products superstores, mass merchants and national contract stationers.
 Such customers periodically adjust the levels of inventory in the retail
 distribution channels, either in retail stores or in distribution centers. The
 Company has determined that lower than expected sales will occur during the
 quarters in which such downward adjustments are made. The Company is not able to
 predict the future effect of such adjustments; however, it is likely that its
 retail customers will continue to adjust inventory levels in future quarters.
  
      The Company's gross profit is directly affected by, among other factors,
 the mix of products sold. Based on the Company's current product categories, the
 Company's gross profit will be negatively or positively affected as the actual
 product sales mix changes.
  
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
  
      Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30,
 1998 was $22.2 million as compared to net cash used by operating activities for
 the six months ended June 30, 1997 of $32.5 million. This increase is primarily
 the net result of the following: (i) cash used by the net loss of $5.3 million
 after adjustment for non-cash expenses, (ii) a decrease in accounts receivable
 of $48.6 million as a result of collection of year end receivable balances and
 improving days sales outstanding in receivables, (iii) a decrease in inventories
 of $13.7 million, (iv) a reduction of accounts payable of $22.9 million, and (v)
 a net change in other assets and liabilities of $11.9 million.
  
      Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 1998
 and 1997 was $8.7 million and $60.1 million, respectively. The first half 1998
 use was due to the purchase of equipment, principally production equipment. The
 first half of 1997 use was due to the Shade/Allied acquisition of $50.5 million
 and purchases of equipment of $9.6 million.
  
      Net cash provided by financing activities during the first six months of
 1998 and 1997 was $13.1 million and $92.0 million, respectively. Net cash
 provided during the first half of 1998 resulted from the net of the repayment of
 $12.0 million in financing outstanding under the accounts receivable credit
 facility, payment of fees in connection with amendments to the bank credit
 agreement of $1.4 million and borrowings of $27.5 million under the bank credit
 agreement. During the first half of 1997, the Company borrowed $110.5 million to
 finance (i) repayment of $18.0 million in notes outstanding under its accounts
 receivable credit facility, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii) the
 purchases of equipment and (iv) its working capital needs.
  
      A portion of the consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at
 floating rates; therefore, its financial condition is and will continue to be
 affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into
 an interest rate protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in
 interest rates.
  
      In February 1998, the Company and its banking group agreed to an increase
 in the size of the revolving credit agreement from $300.0 million to $330.0
 million for a period of one year. After such time, the level of debt available
 under such credit agreement will be reduced to $300.0 million. In December 1997,
 February 1998 and April 1998, certain covenants in the credit agreement were
 also modified as of the end of 1997 and for a period ending in February 1999.
 Unless approved by the banking group, the Company will be restricted to $15.0
 million in net capital expenditures for 1998 and will be restricted from any
 acquisitions. The interest rate incurred by the Company will vary each quarter
 in 1998 depending on the Company's consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio at the
 beginning of each quarter. The Company paid fees and expenses of $1.4 million to
 its banking group and lawyers in connection with the amendments to the credit
 agreement.
  
      As a result of the second quarter loss, the Company was in default of
 certain EBITDA covenants at June 30, 1998. On June 30, 1998 the Company obtained
 an amendment to its credit agreement waiving all defaults of its financial
 covenants through July 31, 1998. On July 24, 1998, the waiver was extended
 through

 September 30, 1998. The extension also amended the credit agreement to provide
 for: changes in the voting procedures necessary to access the additional $30.0
 million available under the credit line and fees of $.3 million to be paid to
 those banks approving the extension. The Company's banking group has not
 accelerated the debt under the bank credit agreement. However, the Company will
 be unable to meet the EBITDA covenants for September 30, 1998 in the current
 bank credit agreement and it is unlikely that the Company will meet such
 existing EBITDA covenants for future measurement dates. As a result, $286,900 of
 the Company's long-term debt has been reclassified as current portion of
 long-term debt at June 30, 1998 as required by EITF 86-30. The Company is
 currently in negotiations with its bank group to obtain a permanent amendment to
 its bank credit agreement with attainable EBITDA and other covenants and
 extended debt maturities. While the Company cannot predict with assurance the
 outcome of such negotiations, the Company expects to obtain such a permanent
 amendment to its bank credit agreement. Once such a permanent amendment is
 obtained, the Company's bank debt will be reclassified to long-term debt on the
 balance sheet.
  
      The ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce
 its total debt will be dependent upon obtaining the previously described
 permanent amendment to its bank credit agreement and the future performance of
 the Company and its subsidiaries. In turn, such performance will be subject to
 general economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors,
 including factors beyond the Company's control. Should the Company not be able
 to obtain such an amendment, the Company would explore other financing
 alternatives. These alternatives include but are not limited to a refinancing of
 its bank debt, raising new private or public debt, raising additional public
 equity capital, reducing the level of capital expenditures, reducing operating
 costs and selling certain assets. While the Company expects that it will obtain
 the previously described amendment to the bank credit agreement and/or that
 other financing will be available and that there will be sufficient funds for
 1999 operations, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the
 bank agreement amendment or financing discussions.
  
      Management believes that, based upon cash on hand of $31.4 million at June
 30, 1998, estimates of current and future operations, and other available
 sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement and the
 accounts receivable facility, its finances will be adequate for 1998 to make
 required payments of principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to
 fund anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $7 million during the
 remainder of 1998, and to meet working capital requirements.
  
 INFLATION
  
      The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
 results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1997.
  
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
  
      The Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) issued Statement of
 Position (SOP) 98-5, which is effective for fiscal years commencing after
 December 15, 1998. SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities,
 prescribes that start-up costs, including organization costs, should be expensed
 as incurred. The SOP states that initial application should be reported as a
 cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company will adopt
 this SOP for its fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. Assuming an effective tax
 rate of 42.5% for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1999, the Company will
 report a charge of $.4 million (net of tax benefit of $.3 million) in the first
 quarter of 1999.

          4. Inability to obtain new customers or retain existing ones.

          9. Significant changes in rates of interest, inflation or taxes.
  
         10. Significant changes in the Company's relationship with its employees

 different from any anticipated results expressed in any forward-looking
 statement made by or on behalf of the Company.
  
      The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
 statements to reflect events or other circumstances after date hereof.
