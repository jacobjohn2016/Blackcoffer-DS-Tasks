               FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
        AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) was incorporated in October 1982.
 AMR's principal subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc., was founded in 1934. On
 April 9, 2001, American Airlines, Inc. purchased substantially all of the
 assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).
 Accordingly, the operating results of TWA since the date of acquisition have
 been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year
 ended December 31, 2001 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
 American Airlines, Inc., including TWA (collectively, American), is the largest
 scheduled passenger airline in the world. AMR's operations fall almost entirely
 in the airline industry.
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
        AMR's net loss in 2001 was $1.8 billion, or $11.43 loss per share. AMR's
 net earnings in 2000 were $813 million, or $5.43 per share ($5.03 diluted). On
 September 11, 2001, two American Airlines aircraft were hijacked and destroyed
 in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon
 in northern Virginia. On the same day, two United Air Lines aircraft were also
 hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. In response to the terrorist attacks,
 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a federal ground stop order on
 September 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the United
 States. Airports did not reopen until September 13, 2001 (except for Washington
 Reagan Airport, which was partially reopened on October 4, 2001). The Company
 was able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights for several days
 thereafter. When flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic and yields
 on the Company's flights were significantly lower than prior to the attacks. As
 a result, the Company reduced its operating schedule to approximately 80 percent
 of the schedule it flew prior to September 11, 2001. Somewhat offsetting the
 impact of the September 11 events, the Company recorded $856 million in
 reimbursement from the U.S. Government under the Air Transportation Safety and
 System Stabilization Act (the Act) (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial
 statements).
 
 REVENUES
 
 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 The Company's 2001 revenues, yield, revenue passenger
 miles (RPMs) and available seat miles (ASMs) were severely impacted by the
 September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company's reduced operating schedule,
 a worsening of the U.S. economy that had already been dampening the demand for
 travel both domestically and internationally prior to the September 11, 2001
 events, business travel declines as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks,
 and increased fare sale activity occurring subsequent to the September 11
 attacks to encourage passengers to resume flying. The Company's revenues
 decreased approximately $740 million, or 3.8 percent, versus 2000. However,
 excluding TWA's revenues for the period April 10, 2001 through December 31,
 2001, the Company's revenues would have decreased approximately $2.6 billion
 versus 2000.
 
        For comparability purposes, the following discussion does not combine
 American's and TWA's results of operations or related statistics for 2001.
 American's passenger revenues decreased by 14 percent, or $2.3 billion. In 2001,
 American derived approximately 68 percent of its passenger revenues from
 domestic operations and approximately 32 percent from international operations.
 American's domestic revenue per available seat mile (RASM) decreased 11.3
 percent, to 9.28 cents, on a capacity decrease of 5 percent, or 104 billion
 ASMs. International RASM decreased to 9.07 cents, or 5.2 percent, on a capacity
 decrease of 4.9 percent. The decrease in international RASM was led by an 11.8
 percent and 10.8 percent decrease in Pacific and European RASM, respectively,
 slightly offset by a 0.9 percent increase in Latin American RASM. The decrease
 in international capacity was driven by a 6.5 percent and 4.7 percent reduction
 in Latin American and European ASMs, respectively, partially offset by an
 increase in Pacific capacity of 2.8 percent.
 
        TWA's passenger revenues were approximately $1.7 billion for the period
 April 10, 2001 through December 31, 2001. TWA's RASM was 7.74 cents on capacity
 of 21.7 billion ASMs.

 <PAGE>
 
 
 
 
        AMR Eagle's passenger revenues decreased $74 million, or 5.1 percent. AMR
 Eagle's traffic remained flat compared to 2000, at 3.7 billion RPMs, while
 capacity increased to 6.5 billion ASMs, or 3.4 percent. Similar to American, the
 decrease in AMR Eagle's revenues was due primarily to the September 11, 2001
 terrorist attacks and a worsening of the U.S. economy that had already been
 dampening the demand for air travel prior to that date.
 
        Cargo revenues decreased 8.2 percent, or $59 million, for the same
 reasons as noted above.
 
 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 The Company's revenues increased approximately $2.0
 billion, or 11.1 percent, versus 1999. American's passenger revenues increased
 by 11.3 percent, or $1.7 billion. The increase in revenues was due primarily to
 a strong U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel both
 domestically and internationally, a favorable pricing climate, the impact of a
 domestic fuel surcharge implemented in January 2000 and increased in September
 2000, a labor disruption at one of the Company's competitors which positively
 impacted the Company's revenues by approximately $80 to $100 million, and a
 schedule disruption which negatively impacted the Company's operations in 1999.
 In 2000, American derived approximately 70 percent of its passenger revenues
 from domestic operations and approximately 30 percent from international
 operations.
 
        American's domestic RASM increased 12.4 percent, to 10.42 cents, on a
 capacity decrease of 1.6 percent, or 109.5 billion ASMs. The decrease in
 domestic capacity was due primarily to the Company's More Room Throughout Coach
 program. International RASM increased to 9.64 cents, or 10.7 percent, on a
 capacity increase of 3.2 percent. The increase in international RASM was led by
 a 16.5 percent, 13.4 percent and 7.8 percent increase in Pacific, European and
 Latin American RASM, respectively. The increase in international capacity was
 driven by a 6.6 percent, 2.7 percent and 0.5 percent increase in European,
 Pacific and Latin American ASMs, respectively.
 
        AMR Eagle's passenger revenues increased $158 million, or 12.2 percent.
 AMR Eagle's traffic increased to 3.7 billion RPMs, up 10.7 percent, while
 capacity increased to 6.3 billion ASMs, or 10.9 percent. The increase in
 revenues was due primarily to growth in AMR Eagle capacity aided by a strong
 U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel, and a favorable pricing
 environment.
 
        Cargo revenues increased 12.1 percent, or $78 million, due primarily to a
 fuel surcharge implemented in February 2000 and increased in October 2000, and
 the increase in cargo capacity from the addition of 16 Boeing 777-200ER aircraft
 in 2000.
 
 OPERATING EXPENSES
 
 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 The Company's operating expenses increased 17 percent, or
 approximately $3.1 billion. However, excluding TWA's expenses for the period
 April 10, 2001 through December 31, 2001, the Company's expenses would have
 increased approximately $888 million versus 2000. In addition to the specific
 explanations provided below, the significant decline in passenger traffic
 resulting from the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 and resulting reduced
 operating schedule caused a favorable impact on certain passenger-related
 operating expenses, including aircraft fuel, other rentals and landing fees,
 commissions to agents and food service. American's cost per ASM increased 6.3
 percent to 11.14 cents, excluding TWA and the impact of special charges - net of
 U.S. Government grant. The increase in American's cost per ASM was driven
 partially by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company's More Room Throughout Coach
 program. Removing the impact of this program, American's cost per ASM grew
 approximately 3.3 percent, excluding TWA and the impact of special charges - net
 of U.S. Government grant. TWA's cost per ASM, excluding the impact of special
 charges - net of U.S. Government grant, was 10.58 cents. Wages, salaries and
 benefits increased 18.4 percent, or $1.3 billion, and included approximately
 $920 million related to the addition of TWA. The remaining increase of
 approximately $329 million related primarily to an increase in the average
 number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases
 that are built into the Company's labor contracts. During 2001, the Company
 recorded approximately $300 million in additional wages, salaries and benefits
 related primarily to the Company's new contracts with its flight attendants and
 Transport Workers Union work groups. This was mostly offset by a $328 million
 decrease in the provision for profit-sharing as compared to 2000. Aircraft fuel
 expense increased 15.8 percent, or $393 million, and included approximately $322
 million related to the addition of TWA. The remaining increase in aircraft fuel
 expense was due to a 4.2 percent increase in the Company's average price per
 gallon, partially offset by a 3.7 percent decrease in the Company's fuel
 consumption, excluding TWA. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 16.8
 percent, or $202 million, due primarily to the addition of
 
 
 
                                        23
 <PAGE>
 new aircraft and an increase of approximately $88 million related to TWA. Other
 rentals and landing fees increased $198 million, or 19.8 percent, and included
 approximately $130 million related to the addition of TWA. The remaining
 increase of $68 million was due primarily to higher facilities rent and landing
 fees across the Company's system. Commissions to agents decreased 19.5 percent,
 or $202 million, and included approximately $59 million related to TWA. The
 decrease in commissions to agents was due primarily to a 13.2 percent decrease
 in passenger revenues, excluding TWA, and the benefit from commission structure
 changes implemented in 2000. Aircraft rentals increased $222 million, or 36.6
 percent, due primarily to the addition of TWA aircraft. Other operating expenses
 increased 11.1 percent, or $368 million, and included approximately $358 million
 related to TWA. Special charges - net of U.S. Government grant included: (i) a
 $685 million asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2001
 related to the write-down of the carrying value of the Company's Fokker 100,
 Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables, (ii) charges resulting from
 the September 11, 2001 terrorist events, including approximately $552 million
 related to aircraft charges, $115 million in facility exit costs, $71 million in
 employee charges and $43 million in other charges, and (iii) an $856 million
 benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the U.S. Government under the Act.
 See a further discussion of special charges - net of U.S. Government grant in
 Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 The Company's operating expenses increased 10.5 percent,
 or approximately $1.7 billion. American's cost per ASM increased by 10.3 percent
 to 10.48 cents, partially driven by a reduction in ASMs due to the Company's
 More Room Throughout Coach program. Removing the impact of this program,
 American's cost per ASM grew approximately 6.9 percent. Wages, salaries and
 benefits increased $663 million, or 10.8 percent, primarily due to an increase
 in the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and
 seniority increases that are built into the Company's labor contracts, an
 increase of approximately $93 million in the provision for profit-sharing, and a
 charge of approximately $56 million for the Company's employee home computer
 program. Aircraft fuel expense increased $799 million, or 47.1 percent, due to
 an increase of 42.0 percent in the Company's average price per gallon and a 3.7
 percent increase in the Company's fuel consumption. The increase in fuel expense
 is net of gains of approximately $545 million recognized during 2000 related to
 the Company's fuel hedging program. Depreciation and amortization expense
 increased $110 million, or 10.1 percent, due primarily to the addition of new
 aircraft, many of which replaced older aircraft. Maintenance, materials and
 repairs expense increased $92 million, or 9.2 percent, due primarily to an
 increase in airframe and engine maintenance volumes at the Company's maintenance
 bases and an approximate $17 million one-time credit the Company received in
 1999. Commissions to agents decreased 10.8 percent, or $125 million, despite an
 11.4 percent increase in passenger revenues, due primarily to commission
 structure changes implemented in October 1999 and January 2000, and a decrease
 in the percentage of commissionable transactions.
 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)
 
 Other income (expense) consists of interest income and expense, interest
 capitalized and miscellaneous - net.
 
 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Interest income decreased $44 million, or 28.6 percent,
 resulting from lower investment balances throughout most of 2001. Interest
 expense increased $71 million, or 15.2 percent, resulting primarily from the
 increase in long-term debt of approximately $4.2 billion. Miscellaneous - net
 decreased $70 million due primarily to 2001 including a $45 million gain from
 the settlement of a legal matter related to the Company's 1999 labor disruption,
 offset by the write-down of certain investments held by the Company. This
 compares to 2000 including a $57 million gain on the sale of the Company's
 warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline.com Incorporated
 (priceline) common stock and a gain of approximately $41 million from the
 recovery of start-up expenses from the Canadian Airlines International Limited
 (Canadian) services agreement.

 <PAGE>
 
 
 
 
 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Interest income increased $59 million, or 62.1 percent,
 due primarily to higher investment balances. Interest expense increased $74
 million, or 18.8 percent, resulting primarily from financing new aircraft
 deliveries. Interest capitalized increased 28 percent, or $33 million, due to an
 increase in purchase deposits for flight equipment. Miscellaneous - net
 increased $38 million due primarily to a $57 million gain on the sale of the
 Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock and
 a gain of approximately $41 million from the recovery of start-up expenses from
 the Canadian services agreement. During 1999, the Company recorded a gain of
 approximately $75 million from the sale of a portion of American's interest in
 Equant N.V. and a gain of approximately $40 million related to the sale of the
 Company's investment in the preferred stock of Canadian. These gains were
 partially offset by the provision for the settlement of litigation items and the
 write-down of certain investments held by the Company during 1999.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
        The impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their
 aftermath on the Company and the sufficiency of its financial resources to
 absorb that impact will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the
 magnitude and duration of the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks on the
 economy in general, and the airline industry in particular; (ii) the Company's
 ability to reduce its operating costs and conserve its financial resources,
 taking into account the increased costs it will incur as a consequence of the
 attacks, including those referred to below; (iii) the higher costs associated
 with new airline security directives, including the impact of the Aviation and
 Transportation Security Act, and any other increased regulation of air carriers;
 (iv) the significantly higher costs of aircraft insurance coverage for future
 claims caused by acts of war, terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other similar
 perils, and the extent to which such insurance will continue to be available;
 (v) the Company's ability to raise additional financing and the cost of such
 financing; (vi) the price and availability of jet fuel, and the availability to
 the Company of fuel hedges in light of current industry conditions; and (vii)
 the extent of the benefits received by the Company under the Act, taking into
 account any challenges to and interpretations or amendments of the Act or
 regulations issued pursuant thereto.

        In response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company
 initiated the following measures: reduced capacity by approximately 20 percent,
 grounded aircraft and deferred certain aircraft deliveries to future years,
 significantly reduced capital spending, closed facilities, reduced its workforce
 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information)
 and implemented numerous other cost reduction initiatives.
 
        Operating activities provided net cash of $511 million in 2001, $3.1
 billion in 2000 and $2.3 billion in 1999. The $2.6 billion decrease from 2000 to
 2001 resulted primarily from a decrease in income.
 
        On April 9, 2001, American purchased substantially all of the assets and
 assumed certain liabilities of TWA for approximately $742 million, which was
 funded from the Company's existing cash and short-term investments.
 
        Capital expenditures in 2001 totaled $3.6 billion, compared to $3.7
 billion in 2000 and $3.5 billion in 1999. In 2001, American took delivery of 26
 Boeing 737-800s, 13 Boeing 777-200ERs and 16 Boeing 757-200s. AMR Eagle took
 delivery of 15 Embraer 140s, seven Embraer 135s, six Embraer 145s and one
 Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft. These expenditures were financed primarily through
 secured mortgage and debt agreements. Ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft were financed
 through sale-leaseback transactions, resulting in cash of approximately $352
 million being received by the Company. Proceeds from the sale of equipment and
 property and other investments of $401 million included the proceeds received
 upon the delivery of five McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft to FedEx.
 
        During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company reached an agreement with
 Boeing that included a combination of aircraft delivery deferrals, substitutions
 and limited additional aircraft orders. As a direct result of the agreement with
 Boeing, the Company's 2002 and 2003 aircraft commitment amounts have been
 reduced, in the aggregate, by approximately $700 million. Following this
 agreement, at December 31, 2001, the Company had commitments to acquire the
 following aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 14 Boeing 777-200ERs, nine Boeing
 767-300ERs, seven Boeing 757-200s, 124 Embraer regional jets and 24 Bombardier
 CRJ-700s. Deliveries of all aircraft extend through 2008. Future payments for
 all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will
 approximate $1.3 billion in 2002, $1.7 billion in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2004 and
 an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion in 2005 through 2008. These future
 payments are net of approximately $470 million related to deposits made for 2002
 aircraft deliveries - which have been deferred as part of the agreement with
 Boeing - that will be applied to future aircraft deliveries. In addition to
 these commitments for aircraft, the Company expects to spend approximately $500
 million in 2002 for modifications to aircraft, renovations of - and additions to
 - - airport and off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various other
 equipment and assets.
 
        During 2001, American issued approximately $2.6 billion of enhanced
 equipment trust certificates which has been recorded as long-term debt. These
 enhanced equipment trust certificates are secured by aircraft, bear interest at
 6.8 percent to 9.1 percent, and mature in 2006 to 2019. Also during 2001, as
 mentioned above, the Company entered into approximately $1.1 billion of various
 debt agreements secured by aircraft. Effective rates on these agreements are
 fixed or variable (based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a
 spread), ranging up to approximately 4.5 percent, and mature over various
 periods of time, ranging from 2007 to 2021.
 
        American has an $834 million credit facility that expires December 15,
 2005. At American's option, interest on this facility can be calculated on one
 of several different bases. For most borrowings, American would anticipate
 choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR. During the fourth quarter of 2001,
 American amended this credit facility to include, among other items, a revision
 of its financial covenants, including modifications to its fixed charge covenant
 and the addition of certain liquidity requirements. The next test of the fixed
 charge covenant will occur on June 30, 2003 and will consider only the preceding
 six-month period. American secured the facility with previously unencumbered
 aircraft. In addition, the facility requires that American maintain at least
 $1.5 billion of liquidity, as defined in the facility, which consists primarily
 of cash and short-term investments, and 50 percent of the net book value of its
 unencumbered aircraft. As of December 31, 2001, $814 million was outstanding
 under this credit facility, at an interest rate of 5.09 percent. The interest
 rate on the entire credit facility will be reset on March 18, 2002.
 
 
 
                                        26
 <PAGE>
 
 
 
 
        In addition, American has available a $1 billion credit facility that
 expires September 30, 2002. Interest on this facility is based upon LIBOR plus a
 spread. This facility is immediately available subject to the Company providing
 specified aircraft collateral as security at the time of borrowing. At December
 31, 2001, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.
 
        Following the September 11, 2001 events, Standard & Poor's and Moody's
 downgraded the credit ratings of AMR and American, and the credit ratings of a
 number of other major airlines. The long-term corporate credit ratings of AMR
 and American were initially retained on review for possible downgrade by
 Moody's, and following subsequent downgrades, were given a negative outlook. In
 addition, the long-term corporate credit ratings of AMR and American remain on
 Standard & Poor's CreditWatch with negative implications. Any additional
 reductions in AMR's or American's credit ratings could result in increased
 borrowing costs to the Company and might limit the availability of future
 financing sources.
 
        The following table summarizes the Company's obligations and commitments
 to be paid in 2002 and 2003 (in millions):

 (*)    Certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities - which
        are supported by operating leases executed by American - are guaranteed
        by AMR and American. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
        for additional information.
 
 (**)   Excludes related interest amounts
 
        In addition to the Company's approximately $3.0 billion in cash and
 short-term investments as of December 31, 2001, the Company has available a
 variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) the
 receipt of the remainder of the U.S. Government grant, which approximates $128
 million, (ii) additional secured aircraft debt (as of December 31, 2001, the
 Company had approximately $4.4 billion net book value of unencumbered aircraft),
 (iii) the availability of the Company's $1 billion credit facility, (iv)
 sale-leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real
 estate, (v) tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities, (vi) securitization of
 future operating receipts, (vii) unsecured borrowings, and (viii) borrowings
 backed by federal loan guarantees as provided under the Act. No assurance can be
 given that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable
 to the Company. However, the Company believes it will meet its financing needs
 as discussed above.
 
        AMR (principally American) historically operates with a working capital
 deficit as do most other airline companies. The existence of such a deficit has
 not in the past impaired the Company's ability to meet its obligations as they
 become due and is not expected to do so in the future.
 
 OTHER INFORMATION
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Subsidiaries of AMR have been notified of potential
 liability with regard to several environmental cleanup sites and certain airport
 locations. At sites where remedial litigation has commenced, potential liability
 is joint and several. AMR's alleged volumetric contributions at these sites are
 minimal compared to others. AMR does not expect these matters, individually or
 collectively, to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial
 position or liquidity. Additional information is included in Note 5 to the
 consolidated financial statements.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the Company's
 financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
 reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The
 Company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual
 results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from
 those estimates. The Company has identified the following critical accounting
 policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the
 Company's financial statements: accounting for long-lived assets, passenger
 revenue, frequent flyer accounting, and pensions and other postretirement
 benefits.
 
        Accounting for Long-Lived Assets - The Company has approximately $21
        billion of long-lived assets as of December 31, 2001, including
        approximately $19 billion related to flight equipment and related fixed
        assets. In addition to the original cost of these assets, their recorded
        value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the Company,
        including estimated useful lives, salvage values and in 2001, impairment
        charges. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
        Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121), the Company records
        impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events
        and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the
        undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
        less than the carrying amount of those assets. In this circumstance, the
        impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value
        of the assets exceeds their fair market value. In making these
        determinations, the Company utilizes certain assumptions, including, but
        not limited to: (i) estimated fair market value of the assets, and (ii)
        estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets,
        which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization,
        length of service the asset will be used in the Company's operations and
        estimated salvage values. During 2001, the Company determined its Fokker
        100, Saab 340 and ATR 42 aircraft and related rotables were impaired
        under SFAS 121 and recorded impairment charges of approximately $1.1
        billion. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
        completed an impairment analysis of its long-lived assets, including
        aircraft fleets, route acquisition costs, airport operating and gate
        lease rights, and goodwill. The impairment analysis did not result in any
        additional impairment charges. See Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated
        financial statements for additional information with respect to each of
        the policies and assumptions utilized by the Company which affect the
        recorded values of long-lived assets.
 
        Passenger revenue - Passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a
        component of air traffic liability. Revenue derived from ticket sales is
        recognized at the time service is provided. However, due to various
        factors, including the complex pricing structure and interline agreements
        throughout the industry, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using
        estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the
        amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based
        upon the evaluation of historical trends, including the use of regression
        analysis and other methods to model the outcome of future events based on
        the Company's historical experience. Due to the uncertainties surrounding
        the impact of the September 11, 2001 events on the Company's business
        (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the acquisition
        of TWA in April 2001 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial
        statements), historical trends may not be representative of future
        results.
 
        Frequent flyer accounting - The Company utilizes a number of estimates in
        accounting for its AAdvantage frequent flyer program. Additional
        information regarding the Company's AAdvantage frequent flyer program is
        included in Item 1 - Business (pages 10 and 11) and Note 1 to the
        consolidated financial statements. Changes to the percentage of the
        amount of revenue deferred, deferred recognition period, cost per mile
        estimates or the minimum award level accrued could have a significant
        impact on the Company's revenues or incremental cost accrual in the year
        of the change as well as in future years. In addition, the Emerging
        Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board is
        currently reviewing the accounting for both multiple-deliverable revenue
        arrangements and volume-based sales incentive offers, but has not yet
        reached a consensus that would apply to programs such as the AAdvantage
        program. The issuance of new accounting standards could have a
        significant impact on the Company's frequent flyer liability in the year
        of the change as well as in future years.

        Pensions and other postretirement benefits - The Company's pension and
        other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated
        utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed
        under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers'
        Accounting for Pensions" and No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
        Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". The Company utilizes
        certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the:
        (i) discount rate, (ii) expected return on plan assets, and (iii)
        expected health care cost trend rate. The discount rate assumption is
        based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change
        in these rates during the year. The expected return on plan assets and
        health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of the Company's
        historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected
        market conditions. In addition, the Company's future pension and other
        postretirement benefit costs and liabilities will be impacted by the
        acquisition of TWA and the new labor agreements entered into during 2001.
        See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
        information regarding the Company's pension and other postretirement
        benefits.
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
 Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business
 Combinations" (SFAS 141) and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
 (SFAS 142). SFAS 141 prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interests method for
 business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and includes criteria for
 the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 includes
 the requirement to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for
 impairment rather than amortize them. The Company will adopt SFAS 142 in the
 first quarter of 2002, and currently estimates the impact to the Company's
 results of operations of discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and route
 authorities to be approximately $66 million on an annualized basis. The Company
 is currently evaluating what additional impact these new accounting standards
 may have on the Company's financial position or results of operations. However,
 with the decline in the Company's market capitalization, in part due to the
 terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the adoption of SFAS 142 may result in
 the impairment of the Company's goodwill.
 
 OUTLOOK
 
        Due in part to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mix
 and yields, the Company continues to have difficulty in estimating the impact of
 the events of September 11, 2001. However, given the magnitude of these
 unprecedented events, the Company expects that the adverse impact to the Company
 - - and to the airline industry as a whole - will continue to be significant in
 2002. Because of the high degree of uncertainty, the Company is not currently
 able to provide an estimate for the full year 2002. However, the Company does
 expect to incur a sizable loss in the first quarter, and will likely incur a
 loss for 2002.
 
        Capacity for American - which reflects TWA in the first quarter of 2002
 but not in the first quarter of 2001 - is expected to increase two to three
 percent in the first quarter of 2002 compared to last year's first quarter
 levels. American Eagle's capacity will be down slightly (see page 8 regarding
 additional information on American Eagle's capacity). Capacity for the remainder
 of 2002 is less clear and depends on a number of factors, including, but not
 limited to, how quickly demand returns and what levels of capacity the Company's
 competitors deploy. Traffic continues to remain challenging to predict. However,
 for the first quarter of 2002, the Company expects traffic to be up about three
 percent from last year's first quarter levels. In response to the September 11
 terrorist attacks, the Company put in place numerous cost reduction initiatives,
 including, but not limited to: cutting capacity, grounding aircraft and
 deferring certain aircraft deliveries to future years, sharply reducing capital
 spending, closing facilities, trimming food service and reducing its workforce.
 In addition, the Company expects to see lower fuel prices in the first quarter
 of 2002 compared to 2001. Somewhat offsetting these cost savings, however, will
 be higher wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs and insurance
 premiums, and greater interest expense. American's unit costs for the first
 quarter of 2002 are expected to be three to five percent higher than last year's
 first quarter.

 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
 
        The preceding discussions under Business, Properties, Legal Proceedings
 and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning of
 Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the Company's
 expectations or beliefs concerning future events. When used in this document and
 in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words "expects," "plans,"
 "anticipates," "believes," and similar expressions are intended to identify
 forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without
 limitation, the Company's expectations concerning operations and financial
 conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues and costs, expectations as
 to future financing needs, overall economic conditions and plans and objectives
 for future operations, the ability to continue to successfully integrate with
 its operations the assets acquired from TWA and the former TWA workforce, and
 the impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on the Company and the
 sufficiency of the Company's financial resources to absorb that impact. Other
 forward-looking statements include statements which do not relate solely to
 historical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss the
 possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which
 indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be
 predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this report
 are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this report.
 The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any
 forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events
 or otherwise. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors that
 could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The
 following factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could cause
 the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
 forward-looking statements:
 
 UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND EVENTS The Company's
 operations could be adversely affected by failure of the Company to reach
 agreement with any labor union representing the Company's employees (including,
 for example, the successful integration of TWA's workforce) or by an agreement
 with any such labor union representing the Company's employees that contains
 terms which prevent the Company from competing effectively with other airlines.
 In addition, a dispute between the Company and an employee work group (outside
 the confines of a collective bargaining agreement) could adversely impact the
 Company's operations.
 
 ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS The airline industry is affected by changes in
 international, national, regional and local economic conditions, inflation, war
 or political instability (or the threat thereof), consumer preferences and
 spending patterns, demographic trends, disruptions to the air traffic control
 system, consumer perceptions of airline safety, costs of safety, security and
 environmental measures, and the weather.
 
 FUEL PRICES / SUPPLY Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry,
 there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to pass on any
 increased fuel prices to its customers by increasing fares. Moreover, to the
 extent there was a reduction in the supply of jet fuel, the Company's operations
 could be adversely impacted.
 
 COMPETITION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY Service over almost all of the Company's
 routes is highly competitive. The Company faces vigorous competition from major
 domestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign
 air carriers, low-cost air carriers, and, particularly on shorter segments,
 ground transportation. Increasingly the Company faces significant competition
 from marketing/operational alliances formed by its competitors. To the extent
 those alliances can undertake activities that are not available to the Company,
 the Company's ability to effectively compete could be hindered. Pricing
 decisions are affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting by
 competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company's financial
 results because the Company is generally required to match competitors' fares to
 maintain passenger traffic. No assurance can be given that any future fare
 reduction would be offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in
 costs or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields.
 
 CHANGING BUSINESS STRATEGY Although it has no current plan to do so, the Company
 may change its business strategy in the future and may not pursue some of the
 goals stated herein.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION Future results of the Company's operations may vary based
 upon any actions which the governmental agencies with jurisdiction over the
 Company's operations may take, including the granting and timing of certain
 governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for
 code-sharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines, restrictions
 on competitive practices (e.g., Court Orders, or Agency regulations or orders,
 that would curtail an airline's ability to respond to a competitor), the
 adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (e.g., new
 passenger security standards), and the adoption of more restrictive
 locally-imposed noise restrictions.
 
 UNCERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Company's current international
 activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as
 reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls,
 currency and political risks, taxation and changes in international government
 regulation of the Company's operations.
 
 ADVERSE IMPACT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS As described elsewhere in this Report,
 the events of September 11, 2001 had and continue to have a material adverse
 impact on the Company. Among the effects experienced by the Company from the
 September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have been significant flight disruption
 costs caused by the FAA's imposed grounding of the U.S. airline industry's
 fleet, significantly increased security and other costs, a reduction in the
 availability of insurance coverage by insurance carriers, significantly higher
 ticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reduced
 yields. The occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or
 international and whether against the Company or another entity) could again
 have a material adverse impact on the Company, its finances and/or its
 operations by further aggravating the aforementioned effects.
 
 AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE FINANCING In the aftermath of the events of September 11,
 2001, the Company raised substantial amounts of money to finance capital
 commitments and day-to-day operations. Although the Company has a substantial
 amount of unencumbered assets, there is no guarantee that it will be able to use
 those assets for financing activities or that these assets will maintain their
 current market value. To the extent that the Company may be unable to access the
 capital markets for long-term capital spending requirements or short-term
 liquidity needs, the Company's finances and/or operations could be adversely
 impacted. As noted elsewhere in this Report, in the aftermath of the events of
 September 11, 2001, credit ratings for the Company's debt instruments were
 downgraded. To the extent the Company's credit ratings are further downgraded,
 it could have an adverse impact on the ability of the Company to access capital
 markets and/or the costs of such financing.
 
 AVAILABILITY OF THE ACT As reported elsewhere in this Report, the Act has
 mitigated some of the material adverse consequences of the events of September
 11, 2001. To the extent there are amendments to, or interpretations of, the Act
 or successful challenges to the Act, any of which are contrary to such
 mitigation, the Company's finances and/or operations could be adversely
 impacted.
