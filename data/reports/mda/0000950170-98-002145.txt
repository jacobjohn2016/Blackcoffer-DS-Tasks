    OF OPERATION
 
 
      On June 30, 1998, the Company announced that the Audit Committee of the
 Board of Directors was initiating a review into the accuracy of prior financial
 statements. The Audit Committee's review has since been completed and, as a
 result of its findings, the Company has restated its previously issued
 Consolidated Financial Statements for 1996 and 1997. (See Notes 1, 13, 14 and
 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 
 OVERVIEW
 
 
      In November 1996, the Company announced the details of a restructuring
 plan. By July 1997, the Company completed the major phases of the restructuring
 plan. The plan included the consolidation of administrative functions, a
 reduction in manufacturing and warehouse facilities (including a reduction in
 the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and warehouses from 61 to 18),
 the elimination of over 6,000 positions (including 3,300 from the divestiture
 of certain businesses described below and approximately 2,800 other positions,
 some of which were outsourced), the centralization of the Company's procurement
 function and the reduction of the Company's product offerings and stock keeping
 units ("SKU's"). The restructuring plan also included the elimination of
 certain businesses and product lines. In fiscal 1997, Sunbeam's core product
 categories were Appliances, Health at Home, Personal Care and Comfort, Outdoor
 Cooking and Away From Home. Other product categories and businesses were
 divested in 1997, including the Company's furniture business and its time and
 temperature, decorative bedding and Counselor/registered trademark/ and
 Borg/registered trademark/ scale product lines. In addition, the Company sold
 its textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in 1997, while entering into a supply
 agreement with the mill for future production of blanket shells.
 
 
      The Company's operating results for 1996 include pre-tax Restructuring and
 Asset Impairment Charges of $110.1 million recorded for the restructuring plan
 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Approximately $29.3
 million of these charges were paid in cash in 1996 and 1997, primarily for
 severance and other employee termination benefits, lease obligations and other
 exit costs associated with facility closures. The Company estimates that
 approximately $5.2 million will be expended in the future, primarily for lease
 obligations. The amounts accrued at December 29, 1996, for Restructuring and
 Asset Impairment Charges recorded in fiscal 1996, exceeded amounts ultimately
 required. Accordingly, the fiscal 1997 Consolidated Statement of Operations
 reflects the reversal of accruals no longer required and resulted in a
 Restructuring and Asset Impairment Benefit of $14.6 million.
 
 
      In 1996, in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan, the
 Company recorded additional charges totaling $129.1 million, reflected in Cost
 of Sales; Selling, General and Administrative Expense ("SG&A"); and Loss on
 Sale of Discontinued Operations. These charges related largely to inventory
 write-downs as a result of the reduction in SKU's, costs related to outsourcing
 and the divestiture of the furniture business. In 1997, the Company incurred
 $38.3 million of expenses related to the restructuring effort undertaken in
 1996. These expenses were primarily for equipment movement, package redesign,
 employee relocation and recruiting, and an additional pre-tax loss on the sale
 of discontinued operations due primarily to lower than anticipated sales
 proceeds. (See Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

      At December 29, 1996, the net carrying value of inventory written-down as
 part of the restructuring and asset impairment charges approximated $37.3
 million. During 1997, this inventory, a portion of which was product of
 discontinued operations, was sold for an amount substantially equivalent to its
 net carrying value.
 
 
      As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
 during the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company charged SG&A for increases of
 $9.0 million in environmental reserves and $12.0 million in litigation
 reserves. As described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
 Company also charged $7.7 million to SG&A expenses in 1996 for compensation
 costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the
 employment of the then new senior management team.
 
 
      During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 1997, approximately
 $0.5 million, $4.5 million, $1.5 million and $21.5 million, respectively, of
 pre-tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to be no longer
 required were reversed and taken into income. Included in these reserves was
 $8.1 million related to the litigation reserve increase in 1996. (See Note 12
 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

      Additionally, effective in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company
 began capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories, whereas, previously
 these inventories were charged to operations when purchased. This change
 increased operating earnings in fiscal 1997 by $2.8 million.

 </TABLE>
 
      After consideration of the adjustments above, 1996 results from continuing
 operations reflect a loss and 1997 continuing operations are marginally
 profitable. Due to a variety of factors, including sales in 1997 which
 increased inventory positions at certain customers, distribution losses during
 1997 and other items, as discussed below, the results for 1997 are not
 indicative of future results. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources,
 below, and in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 1998
 results are expected to be impacted materially by charges related to, among
 other items, a provision for excess inventory, a change in management, changes
 in business operations resulting in part from acquisitions made in 1998, higher
 interest costs related to higher debt levels, costs associated with litigation
 and restructuring and asset impairment costs, as well as costs related to Year
 2000 issues.
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996
 
 
      Net sales for 1997 were $1,073.1 million, an increase of $88.9 million or
 9% over 1996. After excluding: (i) $4.2 million and $30.8 million in 1997 and
 1996, respectively, related to divested product lines which are not classified
 as discontinued operations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding
 and Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ branded
 scales), (ii) $31.3 million of sales in 1997 of discontinued inventory which
 resulted primarily from the reduction of SKU's as part of the 1996
 restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying value was substantially
 equivalent to the sales value, and (iii) a $5.4 million benefit from the
 reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required in 1997
 (cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining net
 sales), net sales on an adjusted basis ("Adjusted Sales") increased 8% over the
 prior year.
 
 
      Adjusted Sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during 1997 primarily from
 new product introductions, expanded distribution (particularly with the
 Company's top ten customers), international geographic expansion and increased
 inventory positions at certain customers. Adjusted Sales growth was
 approximately 19% in the Appliance category and approximately 12% in Outdoor
 Cooking. In the Health at Home category, Adjusted Sales increased approximately
 5% while Adjusted Sales in the Personal Care and Comfort category decreased
 approximately 13% during 1997. As customers reduce inventories to normal
 levels, 1998 sales are expected to be adversely impacted.
 
 
                                        11
 <PAGE>
 
      Sales increases in Appliances were driven by new products, such as
 re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep fryers and toasters,
 and by increased distribution with large national mass retailers, combined with
 higher inventory levels at certain customers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking products
 increased in 1997 attributed to increased merchandising and advertising
 programs, new distribution and higher inventory levels at certain customers.
 During 1997, the Company lost a significant portion of its Outdoor Cooking
 products distribution, including the majority of its grill accessory products
 distribution. Accessories, which accounted for just over 10% of the Outdoor
 Cooking sales volume in 1997, generate significantly better margins than the
 average margins on sales of grills. These distribution changes are expected to
 adversely impact Outdoor Cooking sales and margins in the future, until such
 time as the distribution is regained.
 
 
      Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products suffered during the fourth
 quarter of 1997 as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of
 electric blankets in key northern markets in late 1997 coupled with the
 inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages
 of blanket shells. The Company has shifted to a more level production for
 blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for
 bedding products. Health at Home category sales increased as a result of new
 products and improved distribution in the drug store channels. Both Personal
 Care and Comfort and Health at Home sales were impacted by increased inventory
 positions at customers in 1997. Away from Home sales increased in 1997 as a
 result of new products, including cordless clippers and titanium blades,
 coupled with increased distribution of commercially rated appliances. Also
 contributing to the Company's sales growth in 1997 were its new retail outlet
 stores, of which 22 were open by the end of 1997.
 
 
      International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew
 25% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220 volt
 product introductions and a general improvement in demand in export operations
 and in Mexico. Net sales growth of approximately 35% was achieved in the Latin
 American export sales organization. Most of this growth came from increased
 business with three exporters. In Mexico and Venezuela, sales grew 30% and 24%,
 respectively. Canada accounted for the majority of the remaining international
 sales growth.
 
 
      Excluding the effect of: (i) charges to cost of sales related to the
 restructuring plan in 1996, (ii) the benefit of reducing reserves no longer
 required in 1997, and (iii) the benefit in 1997 of capitalizing manufacturing
 supplies inventories, gross margin as a percent of Adjusted Sales would have
 been approximately 22% in 1997, an improvement of approximately 6 percentage
 points from 16% in 1996. This increase reflects the results of lower overhead
 spending, improved factory utilization and labor cost benefits resulting from
 the Company's restructuring plan, coupled with reductions in certain materials
 costs. The lower overhead spending resulted from a reduction in the number of
 facilities operated by the Company. With fewer facilities used for production
 purposes, the capacity of the remaining plants was more fully utilized. The
 labor cost benefits were realized principally from shifting production to
 Mexico. In addition, a broad based program to obtain lower costs for materials
 contributed to the 1997 margin improvement.
 
 
      Excluding the impact of: (i) the restructuring and asset impairment
 charges to SG&A in 1997 and 1996, (ii) the 1996 charges for the environmental
 accrual, litigation accrual, and restricted stock grant compensation, and (iii)
 the 1997 benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required, SG&A
 improved to 14% of Adjusted Sales in 1997, down 5 percentage points from 19% in
 1996. This improvement was partially the result of benefits from the
 consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate
 headquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels,
 a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company-wide cost control
 initiatives. Higher expenditures in 1996 for market research, new packaging and
 other discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with
 certain of the Company's customers also contributed to the decrease in SG&A
 costs from 1996 to 1997.
 
 
      Operating results for 1997 and 1996, on a comparable basis as described
 above, were earnings of $74.5 million in 1997 and a loss of $34.8 million in
 1996. On the same basis, operating margin increased
 
 
                                        12
 <PAGE>
 
 11 percentage points to 7% of Adjusted Sales in 1997 versus a loss of 4% in
 1996. This improvement resulted from the factors discussed above.
 
 
      Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in
 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997.
 
 
      The 1997 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higher
 than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local
 taxes plus the effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates and the increase
 to the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by the
 reversal of tax liabilities no longer required. For 1996, the effective income
 tax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income tax
 rate. For a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory
 tax rate to the amounts provided, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements.
 
 
      The Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was
 $0.60 per share in 1997 versus a loss per share from continuing operations in
 1996 of $2.05. The Company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per
 share calculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an
 increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the
 exercise of stock options in 1997 and the inclusion of common stock equivalents
 in the 1997 calculation.
 
 
      The Company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March
 1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
 sale and nominal earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture business had net
 income of $0.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated loss on
 disposal of the business of $39.1 million, net of applicable income tax
 benefits. The sale of the Company's furniture business assets (primarily
 inventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March 1997.
 
 
      The Company received $69.0 million in cash, retained approximately $50.0
 million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities related to the
 furniture business. The final purchase price for the furniture business was
 subject to a post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the Asset Purchase
 Agreement and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the
 Company recorded an additional loss on disposal of $22.5 million pre-tax. See
 discussion of Restructuring and Asset Impairment (Benefit) Charges in Note 8
 and Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale in Note 9 to the Company's
 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding sale of the
 furniture business.
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
 
      As described above, the Company's operating results for 1996 include: (i)
 a pre-tax charge of $239.2 million recorded in conjunction with the
 restructuring plan (see Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements), (ii) charges related to increases in environmental ($9.0 million)
 and litigation ($12.0 million) reserves (see Note 12 to the Consolidated
 Financial Statements), and (iii) $7.7 million of charges related to restricted
 stock grants made to the then new management team (see Note 2 to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
 
      Net sales in 1996 of $984.2 million represent a decrease of $32.7 million,
 or 3%, from 1995. Domestic sales represented approximately 80% of total sales
 of the Company in 1996 and decreased $28.5 million or 3% from 1995. This sales
 decline was driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined
 7% and lower sales of bedding products which declined 9% from 1995, attributed
 primarily to lower decorative bedding sales (divested in December 1996).
 Domestic sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new
 products such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced
 pricing on breadmakers. Sales of other product categories such as health and
 personal care products and time and temperature products (divested in March
 1997) were either flat or declined slightly from 1995 levels.
 
 
      The Company's loss from continuing operations was $170.2 million or $2.05
 per share for 1996 versus earnings from continuing operations of $37.6 million
 or $0.45 per share (diluted) in 1995 largely
 
 
                                        13
 <PAGE>
 
 as a result of the restructuring activities discussed above. The net loss for
 1996 was $208.5 million, or $2.51 per share, compared to net earnings of $50.5
 million, or $0.61 per share (diluted), for 1995. Excluding the impact in 1996
 of the charges discussed above, operating earnings decreased from $70.2 million
 in 1995 to a loss of $34.8 million in 1996.
 
 
      International sales decreased $4.2 million or 2% from 1995 primarily as a
 result of lower sales in Latin America which was attributed to political and/or
 economic instability in several countries such as Ecuador, Peru, Columbia and
 Venezuela (which suffered a Bolivar devaluation in April 1996), a sales decline
 of 11% in Canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the Company's then
 largest Canadian customer offset by a 55% increase in sales in Mexico as a
 result of a more stable economic environment in 1996.
 
 
      The Company's gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of
 restructuring and other charges, was 15% of sales in 1996, down from 20% in
 1995, primarily from higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturing
 capacity.
 
 
      SG&A expenses, excluding the impact of the charges described above, were
 19% of sales in 1996 compared with 14% of sales in 1995. The higher 1996
 expenses were due in part to higher than normal spending for market research,
 advertising and similar programs and higher bad debt charges associated with
 certain of the company's customers.
 
 
      Operating losses, excluding the restructuring and special charges in 1996,
 were $34.8 million in 1996, or 4% of sales, as compared with 1995's operating
 earnings of $70.2 million, or 7% of sales. The decrease in operating results
 between years is primarily a result of the factors discussed above.
 
 
      Interest expense increased from $9.4 million in 1995 to $13.6 million in
 1996 as a result of increased indebtedness of the Company for working capital
 requirements and interest capitalized in 1995 related to the construction of
 the Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center.
 
 
      The effective income tax rate for 1996 equaled the federal statutory
 income tax rate. In 1995, the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal
 statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus the
 effect of foreign earning and dividends taxes at other rates. For a
 reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate to
 the amounts provided, see Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
 Statements.
 
 
      The Company's discontinued furniture business had revenues of $227.5
 million in 1996, up 23% from $185.6 million in 1995. This revenue growth was
 attributed primarily to the acquisition of the Samsonite/registered trademark/
 furniture business in November 1995. Excluding the impact of this acquisition,
 furniture business sales declined 2%. Earnings from the discontinued furniture
 business, net of taxes, declined from $12.9 million in 1995 to $0.8 million in
 1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,
 underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. In
 addition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsonite/registered
 trademark/ furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,
 particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses. (See
 Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
 
      During 1997 approximately 90% of the Company's business was conducted in
 U.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export
 sales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority
 of European sales). The Company's exposure to market risk from changes in
 foreign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company's
 non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in
 Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary
 economy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and Mexico reverted to
 hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore,
 translation adjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets
 are included as a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments were
 not material to 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results.
 
 
                                        14
 <PAGE>
 
      On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures
 that arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are
 entered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did
 not have a material impact on the Company's financial results in 1995, 1996 and
 1997. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 
 SEASONALITY
 
 
      On a consolidated basis, the Company's sales do not exhibit substantial
 seasonality; however, sales are strongest during the fourth quarter of the
 calendar year. Additionally, sales of Outdoor Cooking products are strongest in
 the first half of the year, while sales of Appliances and Personal Care and
 Comfort products are strongest in the second half of the year. Furthermore,
 sales of a number of the Company's products, including warming blankets,
 vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weather
 conditions.
 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 
      As of December 28, 1997, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
 $52.3 million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of $316.8
 million and total debt of $195.2 million. Cash used in operating activities
 during 1997 was $6.0 million compared to $14.2 million provided by operating
 activities in 1996. This decrease is primarily attributable to increased
 inventory levels in 1997 and spending in 1997 related to the restructuring
 initiatives accrued for in 1996, largely offset by an increase in cash
 generated by earnings in 1997 and an income tax refund (net of tax payments) in
 1997. Cash used in operating activities reflects proceeds of $58.9 million from
 the Company's revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program
 entered into in December 1997 as more fully described in Note 3 to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that cash used in
 operating activities will increase during 1998, largely from increases in
 inventory levels. As certain inventories built in 1997 in anticipation of 1998
 sales volumes exceed the actual requirements, it will be necessary to dispose
 of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. The Company
 expects to continue to use the securitization program to finance a portion of
 its accounts receivable.
 
 
      Capital spending totaled $60.5 million in 1997 and was primarily for
 capacity expansion initiatives and equipment and tooling for new products and
 cost reduction. The new product capital spending in 1997 principally related to
 the Appliance Category and included costs related to blenders, toasters,
 standmixers, slow cookers and a soft serve ice cream product. Capital spending
 in 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5 million related to the discontinued
 furniture business) and was primarily attributable to equipment for new product
 development, cost reduction initiatives and a $5.0 million warehouse expansion
 financed with a capital lease. Capital spending in 1995 included approximately
 $59.4 million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, $27.4 million related
 to new product development and $10.8 million attributable to the discontinued
 furniture business. The remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost
 reduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance
 including $14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cooking
 products. The Company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5%
 of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions
 and certain facility rationalization initiatives.
 
 
      Cash provided by investing activities also reflects $91.0 million in
 proceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories as part of the
 1996 restructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes
 the purchase of a portion of the Company's furniture business, which was
 subsequently divested in full in March 1997.
 
 
      Cash provided by financing activities totaled $16.4 million in 1997 and
 reflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company's revolving credit
 facility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture
 business and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash proceeds from the
 exercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the
 Company. In 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million was
 primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings
 
 
                                        15
 <PAGE>
 
 to support working capital and capital spending requirements, $11.5 million in
 new issuances of long-term debt and $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of
 treasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In 1995, cash provided by
 financing activities of $27.8 million was primarily from increased revolving
 credit facility borrowings of $40.0 million, offset by $13.1 million used for
 the purchase of the Company's common stock for treasury. In July 1997, the
 Company reduced the amount of available borrowings under its September 1996
 unsecured five year revolving credit facility from $500 million to $250
 million. In early 1998, the Company refinanced substantially all of the then
 outstanding debt (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
      The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings. Substantially
 all of the environmental proceedings of the Company, before consideration of
 the acquisitions discussed below, related to previously divested operations. In
 1996, a review of environmental exposures was undertaken as a result of the
 Company's intent to accelerate the resolution and settlement of certain
 environmental claims. This review and change in strategy resulted in additional
 environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more fully described in Note
 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In management's opinion, the
 ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material
 adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
  
 
      On March 30, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
 acquired approximately 81% of the total number of then outstanding shares of
 common stock of The Coleman Company, Inc. ("Coleman"), in exchange for
 14,099,749 shares of the Company's common stock and approximately $160 million
 in cash, as well as the assumption of $1,016 million in debt. The Company
 expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman pursuant to a
 merger transaction for approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and
 approximately $87 million in cash. In addition, as a result of litigation
 related to the merger consideration, the Company has entered into a memorandum
 of understanding (subject to court approval) pursuant to which the holders of
 the remaining equity interest in Coleman will also receive five-year warrants
 to purchase 4.98 million shares of Sunbeam common stock at $7.00 per share.
 There can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement as
 proposed. (See Part I--Significant Financial and Business Developments, Item
 3--Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 Coleman is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer products for the
 worldwide outdoor recreation market. Coleman's products have been sold
 domestically and internationally under the Coleman registered trademark brand
 name since the 1920's. The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity
 interest in Coleman in the first quarter of 1999.
 
      On April 6, 1998, the Company completed the cash acquisitions of First
 Alert, Inc. ("First Alert"), a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon
 monoxide detectors, and Signature Brands USA, Inc. ("Signature Brands"), a
 leading manufacturer of a comprehensive line of consumer and professional
 products. The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued at
 approximately $178 million and $253 million, respectively, including the
 assumption of debt.
 
      In order to finance the above acquisitions, and refinance substantially
 all of the indebtedness of the Company, Coleman, First Alert and Signature
 Brands, the Company consummated: (i) an offering of Zero Coupon Convertible
 Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2018 (the "Debentures") at a yield to
 maturity of 5% (approximately $2,014 million principal amount at maturity) in
 March 1998, which resulted in approximately $730 million of net proceeds and,
 (ii) entered into a revolving and term credit facility ("New Credit Facility")
 in April 1998, which provided for an aggregate borrowing of up to $1.7 billion.
  
 
      In March, 1998, the Company prepaid a $75.0 million 7.85% industrial
 revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in 2009. In
 connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company will record
 a charge of $8.6 million in the first quarter of 1998. Also, as a result of
 repayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, the
 Company will recognize an extraordinary charge of approximately $104 million in
 the second quarter of 1998.
 
      At June 30, 1998, the Company was not in compliance with the covenants and
 ratios under the New Credit Facility. The Company and its lenders entered into
 an agreement dated June 30, 1998, which
 
 
                                        16
 <PAGE>
 
 provided that compliance with the covenants would be waived through December
 31, 1998. Subsequently, pursuant to an amendment dated October 19, 1998, the
 Company is not required to comply with the original financial covenants and
 ratios under the New Credit Facility until April 10, 1999, but will be required
 to comply with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
 amortization covenant, the amounts of which are to be determined, beginning
 February 1999. At September 30, 1998, following the scheduled repayment of a
 portion of the term loan, the New Credit Facility was reduced to $1,698 million
 in total, of which approximately $1,453 million was outstanding and
 approximately $245 million was available. In addition, the Company's cash
 balance at September 30, 1998 was approximately $43 million.
 
 
      The Company is working closely with its bank lenders and hopes to reach
 agreement with the bank lenders on a further amendment to the New Credit
 Facility containing revised financial covenants which the bank lenders and the
 Company find mutually acceptable. There can be no assurance that such an
 amendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will be
 entered into with the bank lenders by April 10, 1999. The failure to obtain
 such an amendment or further waiver would result in a violation of the existing
 covenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of
 all outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility.
 
 
      In December 1997, the Company entered into a revolving trade accounts
 receivable securitization program, which expires December, 1998, to sell
 without recourse, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, certain trade accounts
 receivable, up to a maximum of $70.0 million. The Company, as agent for the
 purchaser of the receivables, retains collection and administrative
 responsibilities for the purchased receivables. At September 30, 1998, the
 Company had sold approximately $20.0 million of accounts receivable under this
 program.
 
 
      At December 28, 1997, standby letters of credit aggregating $29 million
 were outstanding, primarily for insurance, environmental and workers'
 compensation issues. At September 30, 1998, the standby letters of credit
 aggregated $56 million, including $5 million related to an acquired company,
 and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental and workers'
 compensation issues.
 
 
      For additional information relating to the Acquisitions, Debentures and
 New Credit Facility, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
      The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New Credit
 Agreement, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its
 acquired companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its
 receivable securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital
 needs, capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. However,
 if the Company is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants and
 ratio requirements of the New Credit Facility or obtain a further waiver of the
 existing covenants and ratio requirements prior to April 10, 1999, the Company
 expects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the New
 Credit Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require the
 repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility.
 
 
      See, also, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," above.

 <PAGE>
 
 have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
 financial position, or cash flows, although actual charges incurred may be
 material due to Year 2000 issues, as discussed below.
 
 
 YEAR 2000
 
 
      The Company is continuing the process of assessing the impact of the Year
 2000 on its operations, including those of its subsidiaries Coleman, First
 Alert and Signature Brands which were acquired by the Company in the spring of
 1998. The Company established a Year 2000 Program Management Office in the
 third quarter of 1998 to manage such continuing assessment and the design and
 remediation of the systems with assistance from three consulting firms. The
 Company's continuing assessment encompasses the Company's information
 technology functions along with the impact of the effects of noncompliance by
 its vendors, service providers, customers, and financial institutions.
 Additionally, the Company is assessing the impact of noncompliance of embedded
 microprocessors in its products as well as equipment, such as security and
 telephone systems and controls for lighting, heating/ventilation, and facility
 access.
 
 
      The Company relies on its information technology functions to perform many
 tasks that are critical to its operations. Significant transactions that could
 be impacted by Year 2000 noncompliance include, among others, purchases of
 materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payroll
 processing. Systems and applications that have been identified by the Company
 to date as not currently Year 2000 compliant and which are critical to the
 Company's operations include its financial software systems, which process the
 order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts
 receivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in the
 Company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehouse
 management application. The Company plans to complete corrective work with
 respect to the Company's systems by the second quarter of 1999 with final
 testing and implementation of such systems occurring in the third quarter of
 1999. Management believes that, although there are significant systems that
 will need to be modified or replaced, the Company's information systems
 environment will be made Year 2000 compliant prior to January 1, 2000. The
 Company's failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a material
 adverse impact on the Company. The Company is not able to estimate possible
 lost profits arising from such failure.
 
 
      The Company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers of
 products and services to determine their Year 2000 readiness and plans. This
 review includes third party providers to whom the Company has outsourced the
 processing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions and its
 payroll. The Company plans to complete this review during the fourth quarter of
 1998. The failure of certain of these third party suppliers to become Year 2000
 compliant could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 
 
      Based on a reassessment of the Year 2000 project scope and approach, as
 well as the time frame remaining to implement a solution for the Year 2000
 issue, and an assessment of the requirements for operating information systems
 in the Company, the current estimate of the total costs to address and remedy
 Year 2000 issues and to enhance the Company's operating systems, including
 costs for the acquired companies, is approximately $50 million. This estimate
 includes the costs of software and hardware modifications and replacements and
 fees to third party consultants, but excludes internal resources which are not
 separately tracked by the Company with respect to the allocation of time to the
 Year 2000 issues. The Company expects these expenditures to be financed through
 operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. As of December 28, 1997, the
 Company had expended less than $1 million related to new systems and
 remediation to address Year 2000 and other systems issues, of which the
 majority was for software licenses and was therefore recorded as capital
 expenditures. Of the remaining estimated expenditures, it is anticipated that
 approximately 25% will be incurred in 1998, with the remainder in 1999. As the
 Company continues its assessment of the Year 2000 issues and its information
 requirements to execute its business plans, the actual expenditures incurred or
 to be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above.
 
 
                                        18
 <PAGE>
 
      As part of the assessment of the Year 2000 on its operations, the Company
 plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of the Year
 2000 on its operations, whether due to noncompliance of the Company's systems
 or those of third parties. The Company expects to complete such contingency
 plan by September 30, 1999; such contingency plan will address alternative
 processes, such as manual procedures to replace those processed by noncompliant
 systems, potential alternative service providers, and plans to address
 compliance issues as they arise. Subject to the nature of the systems and
 applications which are not made Year 2000 compliant, the impact of such
 non-compliance on the Company's operations could be material if appropriate
 contingency plans cannot be developed prior to January 1, 2000.
 
 
 EFFECTS OF INFLATION
 
 
      For each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 1997, the
 Company's cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable.
 To the extent possible, the Company's objective is to offset the impact of
 inflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and price
 increases.
 
 
 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
 
      See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for subsequent events
 information relating to, among other matters, a change in management,
 litigation, change in fiscal year end and employment contracts entered into
 with the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and other former senior
 executives of the Company.

 upon sales of Sunbeam's products, (xvi) the numerous lawsuits against the
 Company and the SEC investigation into the Company's accounting practices and
 policies, and uncertainty regarding the Company's available coverage on its
 directors' and officers' liability insurance, (xvii) the possibility of a
 recession in the United States or other countries resulting in a decrease in
 consumer demands for the Company's products, and (xviii) failure of the Company
 and/or its suppliers of goods or services to timely complete the remediation of
 computer systems to effectively process Year 2000 information and the costs
 associated with such remediation. Other factors and assumptions not included in
 the foregoing may cause the Company's actual results to materially differ from
 those projected. The Company assumes no obligation to update any
 forward-looking statements or these Cautionary Statements to reflect actual
 results or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.
