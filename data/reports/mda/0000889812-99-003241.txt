         OF OPERATIONS
 
 
 
 
 1998 ACQUISITIONS.
 
 
      On March 30, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired
 approximately 81% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Coleman from a
 subsidiary of M&F in exchange for 14,099,749 shares of the Company's common
 stock and approximately $160 million in cash. In addition, the Company assumed
 approximately $1,016 million in debt. Immediately afterwards, as a result of the
 exercise of Coleman employee stock options, the Company's indirect beneficial
 ownership of Coleman decreased to approximately 79%. The Company's agreement for
 the acquisition of the remaining publicly held Coleman shares in a merger
 transaction provides that the remaining Coleman shareholders will receive:
 
 
      o approximately 6.7 million shares of Sunbeam common stock--0.5677 of a
        share for each outstanding Coleman share; and
 
 
      o approximately $87 million in cash--$6.44 for each outstanding Coleman
        share and cash outs of unexercised Coleman employee stock options equal
        to the difference between $27.50 per share and the exercise price of the
        options.
 
 
 The Company expects to complete the Coleman merger during the second half of
 1999, although there can be no assurance that the merger will occur during that
 time. See Notes 2 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
 Item 1--"Significant 1998 Financial and Business Developments--Settlement of
 Coleman-Related Claims" for information regarding the settlement of claims
 relating to the Coleman acquisition, the terms of which provide for the issuance
 at the time of the merger of warrants to purchase up to approximately 4.98
 million shares of the Company's common stock at $7 per share.
 
 
      On April 6, 1998, the Company completed the cash acquisitions of First
 Alert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and
 Signature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.
 The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued at
 approximately $182 million, including $133 million of cash and $49 million of
 assumed debt, and $255 million, reflecting cash paid, including the required
 retirement or defeasance of debt, respectively.
 
 
      The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting and
 accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of each acquired
 entity are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the respective
 dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired entities have been
 allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
 estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisals at the dates of
 acquisition.
 
 FISCAL YEAR
 
      To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company and the acquired
 entities, effective with its 1998 fiscal year, the Company has changed its
 fiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December 31 to a calendar year. See
 Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
 ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES
 
   Goodwill
 
      When changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill
 may not be recoverable, the Company estimates future cash flows using the
 recoverability method--undiscounted future cash flows and including related
 interest charges--as a basis for recording any impairment loss. An impairment
 loss is then recorded to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to the
 recoverable amount. The impairment loss taken is no greater than the amount by
 which the carrying value of the net assets of the business exceeds its fair
 value. Due to First Alert's financial performance in 1998 and its prospects for
 1999 and beyond, the Company determined that the goodwill relating to this
 acquisition was impaired. Accordingly, based on its
 
 
                                        26
 <PAGE>
 determination of fair value, the Company has written off the net carrying value
 of goodwill of $62.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1998.
 
 
   Fixed Asset Impairment and Excess and Obsolete Inventory Reserves
 
      In the second quarter of 1998, the Company decided to outsource or
 discontinue a substantial number of products--principally breadmakers, toasters
 and certain other appliances, air and water filtration products and the
 elimination of certain stock keeping units (SKU's) within existing product
 lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill
 accessories--previously made by the Company, resulting in some facilities and
 equipment that will either no longer be used or will be utilized in a
 significantly different manner. Accordingly, a charge of $29.6 million was
 recorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write some of these assets down to their
 estimated fair market value. Approximately 80% of this charge related to
 machinery, equipment and tooling at the Company's Mexico City and Hattiesburg,
 Mississippi manufacturing plants, the estimated fair value for which was derived
 through an auction process. The remainder of this charge related to tooling and
 equipment at various other facilities, which either had a nominal value or the
 fair market value of which was derived through an auction process. These assets
 were taken out of service at the time of the write-down and consequently were
 not depreciated further after the write-down. The net carrying value of these
 assets after the write-down approximated $2.2 million and these assets are
 expected to be disposed of by September 30, 1999. Depreciation expense
 associated with these assets approximated $2.6 million in 1998, $4.2 million in
 1997 and $3.5 million in 1996.
 
 
      Personnel at the Mexico City facility were notified in the second quarter
 of 1998 that the plant was scheduled for closure at year-end 1998; accordingly,
 at that time a liability of $1.8 million was recorded in Cost of Goods Sold
 primarily for employee severance. The employee severance was related to
 approximately 1,200 positions of which approximately 1,100 were terminated, and
 $1.4 million paid in severance, as of December 31, 1998. Substantially all of
 the remaining positions are expected to be eliminated and severance payments
 made by July 31, 1999. In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded in
 Cost of Goods Sold an additional provision for impairment of fixed assets of
 $3.1 million in an acquired entity relating to assets taken out of service for
 which there was no remaining value. The asset impairment resulted from
 management's decision, during the third quarter, to discontinue certain SKU's
 within product lines, principally generators, compressors and propane cylinders.
 These fixed assets were taken out of service at the time of the write-down and
 consequently were not depreciated further after the write-down. Depreciation
 expense associated with these assets approximated $0.8 million in 1998. In the
 fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a $7.1 million charge as a result
 of management's decision, during the fourth quarter, to outsource the production
 of some appliances (principally irons). This charge to Cost of Goods Sold
 primarily consists of a provision for certain tooling and equipment
 ($6.7 million) and severance and related benefits ($0.4 million). This tooling
 and equipment, which had no remaining value, was written off and depreciation of
 this equipment was discontinued at the time of the write-down. Depreciation
 expense associated with these assets approximated $2.4 million in 1998, $2.3
 million in 1997 and $0.9 million in 1996. The severance costs related to
 approximately 45 production employees, none of whom were terminated as of
 December 31, 1998. It is anticipated that these employees' positions will be
 eliminated and the severance obligation paid by September 30, 1999.
 
 
      During 1997 and the first half of 1998, the Company built inventories in
 anticipation of 1998 sales volumes which did not materialize. As a result, it
 has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess
 inventories at amounts less than cost. Accordingly, during 1998, when it became
 evident that the anticipated sales volumes would not materialize, the Company
 recorded $58.2 million in charges (of which $46.4 million, $2.2 million and
 $9.6 million, were recorded during the second, third and fourth quarters,
 respectively) to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market.
 This inventory primarily related to some appliances, grills and grill
 accessories. The Company also recorded a charge of $11.0 million during the
 second quarter for excess inventories for raw materials and work in process
 which will not be used due to outsourcing the production of breadmakers,
 toasters and some other appliances. In addition, during 1998, the Company made
 the decision to exit some product lines, primarily air and water filtration
 products, and to eliminate some SKU's within existing product lines, primarily
 relating to
 
 
                                        27
 <PAGE>
 appliances, grills and grill accessories. As a result of this decision, a
 $26.6 million charge was recorded during the second quarter to properly state
 this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. Total charges for excess
 inventories recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-market, based upon management's
 best estimate of net realizable value, amounted to approximately $95.8 million
 at December 31, 1998. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 for asset impairment and other charges recorded in conjunction with a 1996
 restructuring plan.
 
 
 RESTATEMENTS
 
      On June 30, 1998, the Company announced that the audit committee of its
 board of directors was initiating a review into the accuracy of the Company's
 prior financial statements. The audit committee's review has since been
 completed and, as a result of its findings, the Company has restated its
 previously issued consolidated financial statements for 1996 and 1997 and the
 first quarter of 1998. Based upon the review, it was determined that some
 revenue had been inappropriately recognized, some costs and allowances had not
 been accrued or were improperly recorded, and some costs were inappropriately
 included in, and subsequently charged to, restructuring, asset impairment and
 other costs within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended
 December 29, 1996 and December 28, 1997 and the three months ended March 31,
 1998. The financial statements for the years ended December 28, 1997 and
 December 29, 1996 were restated, audited and filed on Form 10-K/A with the SEC
 on November 9, 1998. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present
 the restated results.
 
 
      In connection with the restatements referred to above, Arthur Andersen
 advised Sunbeam that it believed there were material weaknesses in Sunbeam's
 internal controls. In order to address these material weaknesses, Sunbeam has
 increased the number of senior financial personnel and has implemented
 comprehensive review procedures of operating and financial information.
 Additionally, as explained in more detail under "--Year 2000 Readiness
 Disclosure" within Item 7, the Company is in the process of significantly
 enhancing its operating systems. The Company anticipates that its systems
 enhancements will be completed in 1999.
 
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997
 
 
      Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998 include the
 results of Coleman from March 30, 1998 and of Signature Brands and First Alert
 from April 6, 1998, the respective dates of the acquisitions. The acquired
 companies generated net sales of $1,009.0 million from the acquisition dates
 noted above through December 31, 1998, with corresponding gross margin of $205.1
 million, or 20% of sales. SG&A costs recorded by the acquired companies were
 $329.9 million in the period, yielding an operating loss of $124.8 million.
 
 
      For the acquired companies, net sales from the dates of the acquisitions
 through fiscal year-end were approximately $152 million lower than the same
 period in the prior year. This decline was caused by lower net sales at Coleman
 ($81.5 million), Signature Brands ($31.2 million) and First Alert
 ($39.2 million). Excluding the effects of Coleman's sale of its safety and
 security business in March 1998 and the discontinuation of its pressure washer
 business during 1997, Coleman's 1998 sales would have been approximately
 $4 million lower than in 1997. The Company believes that Signature Brands'
 decline, primarily in its coffee and tea products, resulted largely from lost
 distribution and insufficient attention to the business during part of 1998. The
 Company believes that all of the acquired businesses were, to some extent,
 impacted by the disruption that arose from the integration with the Company and
 the related management changes, both at the acquired companies and at the
 Company. First Alert's sales decline related predominantly to increased
 inventory positions in the domestic channel in 1997 as compared to 1998 with the
 remaining decrease primarily related to more favorable weather conditions in the
 fourth quarter of 1997 as compared to the same period in 1998 which affected
 consumer shopping patterns. Excluding the effects from purchase accounting and
 the write-off of First Alert's goodwill, as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements, operating profit for these three companies
 declined by approximately $45 million since the acquisitions in 1998 as compared
 to the same period in the prior year, resulting primarily from lower net sales.
 Although there can be no assurance, management anticipates that results from
 
 
                                        28
 <PAGE>
 the acquired companies will significantly improve during 1999 due to, among
 other things, the absence of the factors causing disruption and insufficient
 focus at these three companies during 1998.
 
 
      Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 1998 were
 $1,836.9 million, an increase of $763.8 million versus the year ended December
 28, 1997. After excluding:
 
      o $1,009.0 million of sales generated by the acquired companies;
 
 
      o $5.5 million of sales in 1998 resulting from the change in fiscal year
        end, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements;
 
      o $12.7 million in 1998 and $31.3 million in 1997 from sales of excess or
        discontinued inventory for which the inventory carrying value was
        substantially equivalent to the sales value;
 
      o $4.2 million from 1997 sales relating to divested product lines which are
        not classified as discontinued operations--time and temperature products
        and Counselor and Borg branded scales; and
 
      o a $5.4 million benefit in 1997 from the reduction of cooperative
        advertising accruals no longer required (cooperative advertising costs
        are recorded as deductions in determining net sales);
 
 net sales on an adjusted basis ("Adjusted Sales") of $809.7 million in 1998
 decreased approximately 22% from Adjusted Sales of $1,032.2 million in 1997.
 Product sales were adversely impacted by a number of factors, with the largest
 being changes in retail inventory levels from channel loading which took place
 in 1997. Sunbeam believes the year-to-year effect of these inventory reductions
 amounted to over $100 million. Additionally, losses in distribution of outdoor
 cooking products estimated at approximately $60 million, the estimated effect of
 price discounting on appliance and grill products of approximately $14 million,
 and estimated higher provisions for customer returns and allowances of
 approximately $30 million contributed to the lower sales in 1998. The increase
 in customer returns and allowances resulted from:
 
 
      o increased returns of approximately $16 million principally resulting from
        channel loading and other aggressive sales practices (estimated at
        approximately $9 million) which began in the fourth quarter of 1997 and
        continued in the first quarter of 1998, a blanket recall ($3.0 million)
        and the discontinuance of certain product lines (approximately
        $4 million) principally air and water products; and
 
 
      o additional customer allowances of approximately $14 million primarily to
        induce sales during the first quarter of 1998.
 
 
 
 The remaining sales decline was due in part to exiting some product SKU's.
 
 
      Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately 21% or $170 million from
 1997. The Company believes more than half of the sales decline was due to
 increased retail inventory levels in 1997 versus decreased inventory positions
 at customers in 1998. Excluding this effect, sales were still lower than the
 prior year throughout the business, with the most significant decline occurring
 in outdoor cooking products sales. During 1997, the Company lost a significant
 portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority of
 its grill parts and accessories products distribution. The outdoor cooking
 products sales decline was attributable predominantly to this lost distribution
 and to price discounting. The majority of the remaining sales decline was due to
 higher provisions for customer returns and allowances.
 
 
      International Adjusted Sales, which represented 22% of Adjusted Sales for
 1998, decreased approximately 24% compared with the International Adjusted Sales
 for the same period a year ago. The Company believes this sales decline was
 primarily attributable to decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with
 the prior year. Sales were also adversely impacted by a decision to stop selling
 to some export distributors in Latin America and by poor economic conditions in
 that region. In addition, lost distribution in Canada contributed to the sales
 decline from the prior year.
 
 
                                        29
 <PAGE>
      Excluding the effects of:
 
      o the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquired companies'
        operations in the period of $205.1 million;
 
 
      o $0.8 million from the impact of the change in fiscal year-end;
 
      o $128.4 million in 1998 in charges recorded in the second and fourth
        quarters related to excess inventory and fixed assets impairments;
 
      o $15.8 million from the benefit in 1997 from the reversal of reserves no
        longer required, including $5.4 million of cooperative advertising
        accruals; and
 
      o a $2.8 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 1997 resulting
        from capitalizing some manufacturing supplies inventories which were
        previously expensed;
 
 there was a negative gross margin of $29.4 million for 1998 versus a gross
 margin of $223.5 million for 1997. This reduction in gross margin was
 principally attributable to the following:
 
 
      o approximately $145 million related to lower sales volume and unfavorable
        manufacturing efficiencies resulting from lower production levels
        associated with the lower sales volumes and high inventory levels in
        1998;
 
 
      o approximately $65 million related to lower price realization, higher
        costs of customer returns and allowances, and adverse sales mix in 1998;
 
 
      o approximately $12 million related to higher costs in 1998 associated with
        warranty, of which $3.0 million related to a blanket recall, with the
        remaining increase attributable to increased provisions in response to
        higher overall warranty expense experience; and
 
 
      o approximately $20 million related to unfavorable inventory adjustments,
        of which the most significant single factor was physical inventory
        adjustments in the domestic business.
 
 
      Adverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of a majority of the
 grill accessory products distribution as accessories generate significantly
 better margins than the average margins on sales of most of the Company's other
 products.
 
 
      Excluding the effects of the following, SG&A expenses were approximately
 $254 million in 1998, approximately $105 million, or 70%, higher than in 1997:
 
 
      o $329.9 million of SG&A charges in the acquired companies, including the
        $62.5 million goodwill write-off related to First Alert;
 
 
      o $70.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 1998 related to the
        issuance of a warrant to a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, as
        discussed below;
 
 
      o $2.3 million of SG&A expense in 1998 from the change in the fiscal
        period;
 
      o a $3.0 million benefit in 1998 and a $12.1 million benefit in 1997 from
        the reversal of reserves no longer required. The 1998 benefit consists of
        a $3.0 million reversal in the first quarter of 1998 of environmental
        reserves which are no longer required as a result of a favorable
        development at a remediation site. The 1997 benefit consists primarily of
        a $8.1 million reversal of litigation reserves, established in 1996,
        which were no longer required in the fourth quarter of 1997 due to a
        favorable settlement during 1997. The remaining $4.0 million 1997 benefit
        consists of reversals of other accruals primarily relating to consulting
        fees, health insurance and advertising. For further information see
        Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further in this
        Management's Discussion and Analysis;
 
 
                                        30
 <PAGE>
      o approximately $31 million of 1998 compensation expense recorded in
        connection with new February 1998 employment agreements with Sunbeam's
        former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two other former senior
        officers and approximately $3 million of severance in 1998 for some
        former employees. The new employment agreements provided for Sunbeam to
        pay these former employees amounts which reimbursed them for their
        personal tax liabilities resulting from shares issued in connection with
        the accelerated vesting of restricted stock granted under their July 1996
        agreements ($6.9 million), as well as on the new unrestricted stock
        grants under the February 1998 agreements ($9.8 million). The charge also
        includes the value, at approximately $39 per share, of 300,000 restricted
        shares and 45,000 restricted shares which vested in February 1998 for
        Sunbeam's then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two other then
        senior officers, respectively ($13.6 million). In addition, $0.4 million
        was expensed during 1998 relating to the amortization of the 1996
        restricted stock awards. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements for information regarding the terms of these employment
        agreements;
 
 
      o $20.4 million, $6.1 million, and $4.0 million of costs recorded in 1998
        related to costs associated with the restatement efforts, principally
        representing legal, accounting and auditing, and consulting costs of
        $14.1 million, $5.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, Year 2000
        compliance efforts and a corporate office relocation, respectively; and
 
 
      o $15.8 million of restructuring related charges recorded in 1997, charged
        to operations as incurred, represent employee relocation and recruiting
        ($6.2 million), equipment relocation and installation ($5.6 million) and
        package redesign costs ($4.0 million).
 
 
      The increase of approximately $105 million in SG&A expense in 1998 over
 1997 is principally due to several factors:
 
 
      o Corporate administrative costs increased by approximately $47 million,
        reflecting additional personnel and related relocation, travel and other
        costs, as well as increased outside provider fees, telecommunications
        expense and insurance.
 
      o Higher allowances for accounts receivable in 1998, accounting for
        approximately $20 million of the increase, related primarily to
        collection issues with customers in the United States and in Latin
        America, including several major customers who have filed and/or
        threatened bankruptcy.
 
      o Advertising, marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately
        $13 million, reflecting a national television campaign for grills and
        increased activity in market research, package design and sales efforts.
        Higher inventory levels in 1998 and costs associated with outsourcing
        small parts fulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousing costs
        of approximately $12 million.
 
      o Increased environmental reserves for divested and closed facilities added
        approximately $5 million. Approximately half of the environmental reserve
        increase reflected revisions to estimates of costs to remediate existing
        sites. These revisions were based on obtaining additional information in
        the fourth quarter of 1998 about costs of planned remediation actions and
        costs associated with additional remediation actions. The remaining
        amount was to provide for revisions to reserves for estimated losses for
        damages related to environmental sites. These revisions were based on
        obtaining additional information in the fourth quarter of 1998 regarding
        the level of damages sought and the costs and probability of defending
        the Company's position in these actions.
 
 
      o Settlement of a patent infringement action resulted in additional expense
        of approximately $4 million. Remaining legal expenses recorded in the
        year of approximately $1 million for investigation, defense and
        settlement of both new and previously existing issues were nearly equal
        to amounts incurred for similar items in 1997. Additionally, as described
        above, SG&A includes $14.1 million of legal costs recorded in 1998
        associated with the restatement efforts. Amounts accrued for litigation
        matters represent the anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement
        amounts) in connection with pending litigation and claims and related
        anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is both probable
        that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the
        amount can be reasonably
 
 
                                        31
 <PAGE>
        estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company's assessment, after
        consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on the facts and
        circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the
        claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information
        about the plaintiff, and other significant factors which vary by case.
        When it is not possible to estimate a specific expected amount of loss to
        be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of possible losses and
        records the minimum end of the range. As of December 31, 1998 and
        December 28, 1997, the Company had established accruals for litigation
        matters of $31.2 million (representing $17.5 million and $13.7 million
        for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively)
        and $9.9 million (representing $3.0 million and $6.9 million for
        estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively),
        respectively. It is anticipated that the $31.2 million accrual will be
        paid as follows: $22.4 million in 1999, $7.5 million in 2000, and
        $1.3 million in 2001. The Company believes, based on information known to
        it on December 31, 1998, that anticipated probable costs of litigation
        matters existing as of December 31, 1998 have been adequately reserved to
        the extent determinable.
 
 
      During 1997, the Company determined that the amounts accrued at
 December 29, 1996 for Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges recorded in
 fiscal 1996 exceeded amounts ultimately required. Accordingly, the 1997
 Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the reversal of accruals no longer
 required, resulting in a Restructuring and Asset Impairment Benefit of
 $14.6 million. This reversal was reflected in the third ($5.8 million) and
 fourth ($8.8 million) quarters of 1997 when it became evident that such accruals
 were no longer required.
 
 
      On August 12, 1998, the Company announced that, following investigation and
 negotiation conducted by a special committee of the board of directors
 consisting of four outside directors not affiliated with M&F, the Company had
 entered into a settlement agreement with a subsidiary of M&F, pursuant to which
 the Company was released from certain threatened claims of M&F and its
 affiliates arising from the Coleman acquisition and M&F agreed to provide
 certain management personnel and assistance to the Company in exchange for the
 issuance to the M&F subsidiary of a warrant expiring August 2003 to purchase up
 to 23 million shares of the Company's common stock at a cash exercise price of
 $7.00 per share, subject to antidilution adjustments. The Company concluded that
 the agreement to issue this warrant did not result in a new measurement date for
 the purposes of determining the purchase price for Coleman and has accounted for
 the issuance of this warrant as a cost of settling a potential claim.
 Accordingly, a $70.0 million non-cash SG&A expense was recorded in the third
 quarter of 1998, based on a valuation performed as of August 1998 using facts
 existing at that time. The valuation was conducted by an independent consultant
 engaged by the special committee of the board of directors.
 
 
      Operating results for 1998 and 1997, on an adjusted basis as described
 above, were a loss of approximately $283 million in 1998 and a profit of
 approximately $74 million in 1997. This change resulted from the factors
 discussed above.
 
 
      Interest expense increased from $11.4 million for the twelve months of 1997
 to $131.1 million for the same period in 1998. Approximately 70% of the change
 related to higher borrowing levels in 1998 for the acquisitions, with the
 remainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital, capital
 expenditures and the operating losses.
 
      Other income, net increased in 1998 by $4.8 million due to approximately
 $8 million from the settlement of a lawsuit, and approximately $4 million of
 increased net gains from foreign exchange in the period. The foreign exchange
 net gains were primarily from Mexico. Increased losses on sales of fixed assets
 of approximately $5 million and increased expenses related to the bank credit
 facility partially offset the above mentioned income. The increased credit
 facility expenses largely related to unused facility fees.
 
      The minority interest reported in 1998 relates to the minority interest
 held in Coleman by public shareholders.
 
      During 1998, the current tax provision arose largely from taxes on the
 earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as franchise taxes. Deferred tax
 benefits were recognized in 1998 principally due to net operating losses
 
 
                                        32
 <PAGE>
 incurred subsequent to the acquisitions. These benefits were realized through
 the use of deferred tax credits that were established in connection with the
 acquisitions to the extent that such credits are expected to be realized in the
 loss carryforward period. Throughout 1998, the Company increased the income tax
 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to $290.5 million. This increase
 reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that these
 deferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income. This
 assessment, which was initially made in the fourth quarter of 1997, resulted
 from the significant leverage undertaken by the Company in connection with its
 acquisitions and the continuing decline in the Company's net sales and earnings,
 as well as the operating losses incurred throughout the 1998 year. The 1997
 effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate
 primarily due to state taxes, the effects of foreign earnings and dividends
 taxed at other rates and the impact of providing a valuation allowance on
 deferred tax assets.
 
 
      In 1998, the Company prepaid debt assumed in the acquisitions and prepaid
 an industrial revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. The debt assumed
 in connection with the Coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of the
 requirements under the terms of the Company's new credit facility. In connection
 with these early extinguishments of debt, the Company recognized an
 extraordinary charge of $122.4 million, consisting of redemption premiums
 ($106.9 million), unamortized debt discount ($13.8 million) and unamortized
 deferred financing costs ($1.7 million).
 
 
      The Company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March
 1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
 sale and nominal earnings for that period. As a result of the sale of the
 Company's furniture business assets (primarily inventory, property, plant and
 equipment), the Company received $69.0 million in cash, retained approximately
 $50 million in accounts receivable and retained some liabilities. The final
 purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post-closing
 adjustment based on the terms of the sale agreement and in the first quarter of
 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss on
 disposal of $14.0 million net of applicable income tax benefits of
 $8.5 million.
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996
 
   1996 Restructuring Plan and Other Charges and Benefits
 
      In November 1996, the Company announced the details of a restructuring
 plan. The plan included:
 
 
      o the consolidation of administrative functions;
 
      o the reduction of manufacturing and warehouse facilities;
 
      o the centralization of the Company's procurement function;
 
 
      o the reduction of the Company's product offerings and SKUs; and
 
 
      o the elimination of some businesses and product lines.
 
      As part of the restructuring plan, the Company consolidated six divisional
 and regional headquarters functions into a single worldwide corporate
 headquarters and outsourced some back office activities resulting in a reduction
 in total back-office/administrative headcount. Overall, the restructuring plan
 called for a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and
 the elimination of over 6,000 positions from the Company's workforce, including
 3,300 from the disposition of some business operations and the elimination of
 approximately 2,800 other positions, some of which were outsourced. The Company
 completed the major phases of the restructuring plan by July 1997.
 
 
      The 1996 restructuring plan was unable to improve earnings over the long
 term for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, its failure to
 realize some of the anticipated costs savings and the negative impact that
 implementation of the restructuring plan had on sales, product quality, customer
 service, research and development and the introduction of new products. The
 Company's current strategy is to create
 
 
                                        33
 <PAGE>
 innovative new products that anticipate consumer needs, develop effective
 marketing and advertising programs, build relationships, create the right
 culture and choose the right people.
 
 
      In conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring plan, the
 Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $239.2 million in the fourth quarter of
 1996. This amount is recorded as follows in the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations:
 
 
      o $110.1 million recorded in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges, as
        further described below;
 
      o $60.8 million in Cost of Goods Sold related principally to inventory
        write-downs to net realizable value as a result of a reduction in SKU's
        and costs of inventory liquidation programs;
 
 
      o $10.1 million in SG&A expense, for period costs, which were charged to
        operations as incurred, principally relating to employee relocation and
        recruiting, equipment relocation and installation ($3.2 million),
        transitional fees relating to outsourcing arrangements ($4.9 million) and
        package redesign costs ($2.0 million); and
 
 
      o $58.2 million ($39.1 million net of taxes) in Loss on Sale of
        Discontinued Operations related to the divestiture of its furniture
        business.
 
 In 1997, upon completion of the sale of the furniture business, the Company
 recorded an additional pre-tax loss of $22.5 million from discontinued
 operations ($14.0 million net of taxes) due primarily to lower than anticipated
 sales proceeds relating to the post closing adjustment that was part of the sale
 agreement.
 
 
      Amounts included in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in 1996 in
 the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations included anticipated cash
 charges such as severance and other employee costs of $24.7 million, lease
 obligations of $12.6 million and other exit costs associated with facility
 closures and related to the implementation of the restructuring plan of $4.1
 million, principally representing costs related to clean-up and restoration of
 owned and leased facilities for either sale or return to the landlord.
 
 
      Included in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges of $110.1 million in
 1996 was $68.7 million of non-cash charges principally consisting of:
 
 
      o asset write-downs to net realizable value of $22.5 million for disposals
        of excess facilities and equipment and product lines;
 
      o write-offs of redundant computer systems of $12.3 million from the
        administrative back-office consolidations and outsourcing initiatives;
 
      o write-off of intangibles of $10.1 million relating to discontinued
        product lines;
 
      o write-off of capitalized product and package design costs and other
        expenses of $9.0 million related to exited product lines and SKU
        reductions. Prior to 1996, the Company had capitalized certain costs
        related to international product development and package design, which
        were amortized over the period of related benefit. The product
        development costs ($1.9 million) related to international operations and
        represented the costs necessary to modify products for introduction to
        the international markets. As the restructuring plan included the closure
        of the International Group office and elimination of a number of products
        to which these costs pertained, the related capitalized costs were
        written off. Additionally, in connection with the restructuring plan, as
        a result of the elimination of many products and SKU's, the Company
        updated its package designs. Accordingly, the unamortized balance of the
        capitalized package design costs which had been capitalized prior to 1996
        ($5.0 million) was written off. The Company discontinued incurring costs
        of a significant nature relating to these items and consequently has
        discontinued capitalizing such costs subsequent to 1995; and
 
 
      o asset write-downs of $14.8 million related to the divestiture of some
        non-core products and businesses.
 
 
                                        34
 <PAGE>
 The asset write-downs of $22.5 million and write-offs of $12.3 million discussed
 above included equipment taken out of service in 1996 (either abandoned in 1996
 or sold in 1997) and, accordingly, depreciation was not recorded subsequent to
 the date of the impairment charge. The asset write-downs of $14.8 million
 related to the divestiture of non-core products and businesses resulted from
 divesting the time and temperature business in March 1997 and Counselor and Borg
 scale product lines in May 1997 and the sale of the textile mill in Biddeford,
 Maine in May 1997. These charges primarily represented the estimated non-cash
 losses resulting from the sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment, based
 on the estimated net proceeds from the sale of these assets compared to their
 recorded net book value, related to exiting these product lines.
 
 
      The $24.7 million for severance and other employee costs, including COBRA
 and other fringe benefits, related to approximately 3,700 positions that were
 planned to be eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan, excluding
 approximately 2,400 employees terminated from the furniture business for which
 severance was included in Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations. See Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The furniture business was sold
 in 1997. In 1996 and 1997, approximately 1,200 employees and 1,800 employees,
 respectively, were terminated from continuing operations. Due largely to
 attrition, the remaining planned terminations were not required. In 1997, the
 Company determined that its severance and employee benefit costs were less than
 originally accrued principally due to lower than expected COBRA and workers
 compensation costs and, accordingly, reversed accruals of $7.9 million in the
 third ($2.1 million) and fourth ($5.8 million) quarters. At December 31, 1997,
 the balance accrued of $1.2 million represented the remaining severance and
 employee benefit costs for some employees terminated during 1997. During 1998,
 all amounts were expended.
 
 
      The amounts accrued at December 29, 1996 for Restructuring and Asset
 Impairment Charges recorded in fiscal 1996, exceeded amounts ultimately required
 principally due to reductions in anticipated severance and employee benefit
 costs of $7.9 million, as discussed above, and reductions in estimated lease
 payments of $6.7 million ($3.7 million and $3.0 million recognized in the third
 and fourth quarters, respectively) resulting from better than anticipated
 rentals received under sub-leases and favorable negotiation of lease
 terminations. Accordingly, the fiscal 1997 Consolidated Statement of Operations
 included $14.6 million of benefit ($5.8 million in the third quarter and
 $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1997) related to the reversal of accruals
 no longer required, which were recorded as these reduced obligations became
 known.
 
 
      In 1996, in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan, the
 Company recorded additional charges totaling $129.1 million, reflected in Cost
 of Goods Sold, SG&A expense, and Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations. The
 charge included in Cost of Goods Sold of $60.8 million principally represented
 inventory write-downs to net realizable value and anticipated losses on the
 disposition of the inventory as a result of the significant reduction in SKU's
 provided for in the restructuring plan. The write-down to net realizable value,
 based upon management's best estimates, included $26.9 million related to raw
 materials, work-in process and finished goods for discontinued outdoor cooking
 products, principally grills and grill accessories and the balance related to
 raw materials, work-in process and finished goods for other discontinued
 products including appliances ($27.8 million), clippers ($1.0 million) and
 blankets ($5.1 million). For inventory which management determined was saleable,
 the estimated write-down was based upon the difference between the expected net
 sales proceeds of the inventory, depending upon distribution channel, and the
 recorded value of the inventory. In the case of abandoned inventory, the write-
 down was equal to the recorded value of the inventory. The resulting difference
 between carrying value and estimated net realizable value represented the
 $60.8 million write-down necessary to record the inventory at its net realizable
 value. SG&A expense included period costs, charged to operations as incurred, in
 1997 and 1996 of $15.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively, relating to
 employee relocation and recruiting and equipment installation and relocation
 ($11.8 million in 1997 and $3.2 million in 1996) transitional fees relating to
 outsourcing arrangements ($4.9 million in 1996), and package redesign costs
 ($4.0 million in 1997 and $2.0 million in 1996) expended as a result of the
 implementation of the restructuring plan. The 1996 Loss on Sale of Discontinued
 Operations related to the divestiture of the Company's furniture business. In
 1996, the Company decided to divest its furniture operations and recorded an
 estimated pre-tax loss of $58.2 million related to the sale of assets, primarily
 fixed assets and inventory. In 1997, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax
 loss of $22.5 million due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds
 resulting from the post closing adjustment as provided for in the sale
 agreement. See Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 <PAGE>
      At December 28, 1997, the Company had $5.2 million in liabilities accrued
 related to the 1996 restructuring plan, including $1.2 million of severance
 related costs and $4.0 million related to facility closures, which principally
 represented future lease payments, net of sub-leases, on exited facilities.
 During 1998, this liability was reduced by $4.0 million as a result of cash
 expenditures. At December 28, 1997, the Company had $3.0 million of warranty
 liabilities related to the discontinued furniture operations. During 1998, $2.5
 million of this liability was liquidated.

 </TABLE>
 
 
      At December 29, 1996, the net realizable value of the remaining inventory
 written-down as part of the restructuring and asset impairment charges was
 approximately $37.3 million. During 1997, this inventory, a portion of which was
 product of discontinued operations, was sold for amounts substantially
 equivalent to its net carrying value.
 
      As further discussed in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
 Statements, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company charged SG&A for
 increases of $9.0 million in environmental reserves and $12.0 million in
 litigation reserves. In the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company performed a
 comprehensive review of all environmental exposures in an attempt by the then
 new senior management team to accelerate the resolution and settlement of
 environmental claims. As a result, upon the conclusion of the review, the
 Company recorded additional environmental reserves of $9.0 million in the fourth
 quarter of 1996. The litigation charge of $12.0 million was recorded due to an
 unfavorable court ruling in January 1997, which held that the Company was liable
 for environmental remediation costs related to the operations of a successor
 company. As a result of this ruling, the Company provided for this liability in
 the fourth quarter of 1996. In
 
 
                                        36
 <PAGE>
 the fourth quarter of 1997, this case was settled and, as a result, $8.1 million
 of the charge was reversed into income, primarily in the fourth quarter of 1997.
 
 
      As described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
 Company also charged $7.7 million to SG&A expenses in 1996 for compensation
 costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the
 employment of the then new senior management team.
 
 
      During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 1997, approximately
 $0.5 million, $4.5 million, $1.5 million and $21.5 million, respectively, of
 pre-tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to be no longer
 required were reversed and taken into income. These amounts were primarily
 related to:
 
      o the litigation reserve of $8.1 million discussed above, resulting in a
        reduction in SG&A expenses;
 
 
      o inventory valuation allowances of $7.0 million, resulting in a reduction
        in Cost of Goods Sold;
 
 
      o cooperative advertising allowances of $5.4 million, resulting in an
        increase in net sales;
 
 
      o liabilities for exiting of facilities and plant consolidations provided
        for prior to 1996 of $3.5 million, resulting in a decrease in Cost of
        Goods Sold; and
 
 
      o consulting fee accruals of $1.3 million, which resulted in a decrease in
        SG&A expenses.
 
 
 These liabilities were provided for by the Company, principally in 1996, based
 upon its best available estimate at the time of the probable liabilities. When
 information became available that the amounts provided were in excess of what
 was required, the Company reduced the applicable reserves and recorded increases
 in Net Sales of $5.4 million, reductions in Cost of Goods Sold of $10.5 million
 and reductions in SG&A expenses of $12.1 million.
 
 
      Additionally, effective in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company
 changed its method of accounting to capitalize manufacturing supplies
 inventories, whereas, previously these inventories were charged to operations
 when purchased. This change reduced Cost of Goods Sold in fiscal 1997 by $2.8
 million.
 
 
   Results of Operations for 1997 Compared to 1996
 
      Net sales for 1997 were $1,073.1 million, an increase of $88.9 million or
 9% over 1996. After excluding the following, Adjusted Sales increased 8% over
 the prior year to $1,032.2 million from $953.4 million in 1996:
 
      o $4.2 million and $30.8 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively, related to
        divested product lines which were not classified as discontinued
        operations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding and
        Counselor and Borg branded scales);
 
      o $31.3 million of sales in 1997 of discontinued inventory which resulted
        primarily from the reduction of SKU's as part of the 1996 restructuring
        plan and for which the inventory carrying value was substantially
        equivalent to the sales value; and
 
 
      o a $5.4 million benefit from the reduction of cooperative advertising
        accruals no longer required in 1997.
 
      Adjusted Sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during 1997 primarily from
 new product introductions, expanded distribution, particularly with Sunbeam's
 top ten customers, international geographic expansion and increased inventory
 positions at some customers. Adjusted Sales growth was approximately 19% for
 appliances and approximately 12% in outdoor cooking. Adjusted Sales for health
 products increased approximately 5% while Adjusted Sales of personal care
 products and blankets decreased approximately 13% during 1997.
 
      Sales increases in appliances of approximately $69 million were driven by
 new products, such as redesigned blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep
 fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass
 retailers, combined with higher inventory levels at some customers. Sales of
 outdoor cooking products increased approximately $30 million in 1997 attributed
 to increased merchandising and advertising programs, new distribution and higher
 inventory levels at some customers. During 1997, the Company lost a significant
 portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority of
 its grill accessory products distribution. Accessories, which accounted for just
 over 10% of the outdoor cooking
 
 
                                        37
 <PAGE>
 sales volume in 1997, generate significantly better margins than the average
 margins on sales of grills. These distribution changes are expected to adversely
 impact outdoor cooking sales and margins in the future, until such time as the
 distribution is regained.
 
 
      Sales of personal care products and blankets suffered during the fourth
 quarter of 1997 as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of
 electric blankets in key northern markets in late 1997 coupled with the
 inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages
 of blanket shells. The Company shifted to a more level production for blankets
 in 1998 in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for bedding
 products. Sales of health products as well as personal care and bedding products
 were impacted by increased inventory positions at customers in 1997.
 
 
      International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew
 25% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220 volt
 product introductions and a general improvement in demand in export operations
 and in Mexico. Net sales growth of approximately 35% was achieved in the Latin
 American export sales organization. Most of this growth came from increased
 business with three exporters. In Mexico and Venezuela, sales grew 30% and 24%,
 respectively. Canada accounted for the majority of the remaining international
 sales growth.
 
      Excluding the effects of:
 
      o charges of $60.8 million to Cost of Goods Sold related to the
        restructuring plan in 1996;
 
      o the $15.9 million benefit of reducing reserves no longer required in
        1997; and
 
      o the $2.8 million benefit in 1997 of capitalizing manufacturing supplies
        inventories;
 
 gross margin as a percent of Adjusted Sales would have been approximately 22% in
 1997, an improvement of approximately 6 percentage points from 16% in 1996. This
 increase reflects the results of lower overhead spending, improved factory
 utilization and labor cost benefits resulting from the Company's restructuring
 plan, coupled with reductions in materials costs. The lower overhead spending
 resulted from a reduction in the number of facilities operated by the Company.
 With fewer facilities used for production purposes, the capacity of the
 remaining plants was more fully utilized. The labor cost benefits were realized
 principally from shifting production to Mexico. In addition, a broad based
 program to obtain lower costs for materials contributed to the 1997 margin
 improvement.
 
 
      Excluding the impact of:
 
      o the restructuring and asset impairment period costs to SG&A expense of
        $15.8 million in 1997 and $10.1 million in 1996;
 
      o the 1996 charges for the environmental accrual of $9.0 million,
        litigation accrual of $12.0 million and restricted stock grant
        compensation of $7.7 million; and
 
      o the 1997 benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required of
        $12.1 million;
 
 SG&A improved to 14% of Adjusted Sales in 1997, down 5 percentage points from
 19% in 1996. This improvement was partially the result of benefits from the
 consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate
 headquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels,
 a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company-wide cost control
 initiatives. Higher expenditures in 1996 for market research, new packaging and
 other discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with some of
 the Company's customers also contributed to the decrease in SG&A expense from
 1996 to 1997. The expense for doubtful accounts and cash discounts was
 $17.3 million in 1997 as compared to $27.1 million in 1996. The principal factor
 in the decrease in bad debt expenses during this period was the acceleration of
 the consolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the related competitive
 environment, which resulted in a number of troubled retailers and related
 bankruptcies during 1996. This resulted in the significant amount of bad debt
 write-offs--$19.9 million--in 1996.
 
 
      The restructuring accrual, which existed at January 1, 1996 ($13.8
 million), was initially established as part of a "rightsizing program" during
 fiscal 1992. During 1996, approximately $3 million of this accrual was utilized
 and the remaining $10.8 million became part of the reserve requirements of the
 1996 restructuring plan. In effect, in 1996, Sunbeam reversed the $10.8 million
 prior year accrual determined to be no longer required and provided a
 corresponding amount in connection with the 1996 restructuring charge.
 
 
                                        38
 <PAGE>
      Operating results for 1997 and 1996, on a comparable basis as described
 above, were earnings of $74.5 million in 1997 and a loss of $34.8 million in
 1996. On the same basis, operating margin increased 11 percentage points to 7%
 of Adjusted Sales in 1997 versus a loss of 4% in 1996. This improvement resulted
 from the factors discussed above.
 
      Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in
 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997.
 
      The 1997 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higher
 than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes plus the
 effect of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the increase
 to the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by the reversal
 of tax liabilities no longer required. During the fourth quarter of 1997,
 approximately $13.3 million of tax liabilities related to the 1993 and 1994 tax
 years were determined to be no longer required and were reversed and taken into
 income. These accruals were no longer required because during the fourth quarter
 of 1997 the Company reached a resolution with the Internal Revenue Service on
 its audits of the 1993 and 1994 tax years. Additionally, in the fourth quarter
 of 1997, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $23.2 million
 reflecting management's assessment that it was more likely than not that the
 deferred tax asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Of this
 amount, $18.9 million related to deferred tax assets, the majority of which was
 recognized as a benefit in the first three quarters of 1997. The remainder
 related to minimum pension liabilities and was therefore recorded as an
 adjustment to shareholders' equity. This assessment was made as a result of the
 significant leverage incurred by the Company to finance the acquisitions and the
 significant decline in net sales and earnings from anticipated levels during the
 fourth quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. For 1996, the effective
 income tax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income
 tax rate.
 
 
      The Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was
 $0.60 per share in 1997 versus a loss per share from continuing operations in
 1996 of $2.05. The Company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per
 share calculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an
 increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the exercise
 of stock options in 1997 and the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the
 1997 calculation.
 
 
      The Company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March
 1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
 sale and nominal earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture business had net
 income of $0.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated loss on
 disposal of the business of $39.1 million, net of applicable income tax
 benefits. The sale of the Company's furniture business assets--primarily
 inventory, property, plant and equipment--was completed in March 1997. The
 Company received $69.0 million in cash, retained approximately $50.0 million in
 accounts receivable and retained some liabilities related to the furniture
 business. The final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a
 post-closing adjustment under the terms of the sale agreement, and in the first
 quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company recorded an
 additional pre-tax loss on disposal of $22.5 million. Although the discontinued
 furniture business was profitable, net income had declined from $21.7 million in
 1994 to $0.8 million in 1996. This decline, along with the Company's
 announcement that it intended to divest this line of business contributed to the
 loss on the sale. See discussion of restructuring and asset impairment (benefit)
 charges in Note 12 and discontinued operations in Note 13 of Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding sale of the
 furniture business.

 </TABLE>
 
 
      After consideration of the adjustments above, 1998 and 1996 results from
 continuing operations reflect losses and 1997 continuing operations are
 marginally profitable. Due to a variety of factors, including increased
 inventory positions at some customers and manufacturing and sourcing activities
 during 1997 and the first half of 1998 which increased the Company's inventory
 position, the results for each of 1998 and 1997 are not indicative of future
 results. Results for 1999 are expected to be impacted by the continuing effects
 of the Company's excess inventory position, as well as costs related to Year
 2000 compliance efforts.
 
 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
      Approximately 80% of the Company's business is conducted in U.S. dollars,
 including domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales, primarily to
 Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of European sales. The
 Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries
 in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico. Mexico reverted to a
 hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translation
 adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets are included as a component
 of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is no longer considered hyperinflationary as of
 January 1, 1999. This change in Mexico's hyperinflationary status is not
 expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial results.
 Translation adjustments resulting from the Company's non-U.S. denominated
 subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the Company's financial
 condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 
      While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not been significant,
 economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative effect on
 earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in Latin America
 have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales in and
 exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as the economic
 environments in those regions remain unsettled.
 
      On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives--foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts--to manage foreign exchange exposures that
 arise in the normal course of business. No derivative
 
 
                                        40
 <PAGE>
 contracts are entered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of
 derivatives has not had a material impact on the Company's financial results.
 See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
 EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK
 
   Qualitative Information
 
      The Company uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage
 its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not speculate
 on interest rates or foreign currency rates. Instead, it uses derivatives when
 implementing its risk management strategies to reduce the possible effects of
 these exposures.
 
 
      With respect to foreign currency exposures, the Company is most vulnerable
 to changes in rates between the United States dollar/Japanese yen, Canadian
 dollar, German deutschemark, Mexican peso and Venezuelan bolivar exchange rates.
 The Company principally uses forward and option contracts to reduce risks
 arising from firm commitments, intercompany sales transactions and intercompany
 receivable and payable balances. The Company generally uses interest rate swaps
 to fix some of its variable rate debt. The Company manages credit risk related
 to these derivative contracts through credit approvals, exposure limits and
 threshold amounts and other monitoring procedures.
 
 
   Quantitative Information
 
      Below are tables of information related to the Company's investments in
 market risk sensitive instruments. All of the instruments in the following
 tables have been entered into by the Company for purposes other than trading
 purposes.
 
 
      Interest Rate Sensitivity.  The table below provides information about the
 Company's derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that
 are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and
 debt obligations.
 
 
      For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected
 maturity date and related (weighted) December 31, 1998 average interest rates.
 Included in the debt position are the debentures, which carry no intervening
 cash flows but mature in 2018. For interest rate swaps, the table presents
 notional amounts and weighted average interest rates for the contracts at the
 current time. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to
 be exchanged under the contracts.

 (1) The fair value of fixed rate debt is estimated using either reported
     transaction values or discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of
     variable rate debt is assumed to approximate market value based on the
     periodic adjustments of the interest rates to the current market rates in
     accordance with the terms of the agreements. The fair value of the interest
     rate swaps is based on estimates of the cost of terminating the swaps.

 EURO CONVERSION
 
      On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union
 established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
 European Union's common currency (the "Euro"). The transition period for the
 introduction of the Euro is between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. The
 Company has been preparing for the introduction of the Euro and continues to
 evaluate and address the many issues
 
 
                                        42
 <PAGE>
 involved, including the conversion of information technology systems,
 recalculating currency risk, strategies concerning continuity of contracts, and
 impacts on the processes for preparing taxation and accounting records. Based on
 the work to date, the Company believes the Euro conversion will not have a
 material impact on its results of operations.
 
 
 SEASONALITY
 
      Sunbeam's consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial
 seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the second
 quarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,
 including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alert
 products, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weather
 conditions.
 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Debt Instruments
      In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert and Signature
 Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of Sunbeam and the
 three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering of debentures at a
 yield to maturity of 5%--approximately $2,014 million principal amount at
 maturity--in March 1998, which resulted in approximately $730 million of net
 proceeds and borrowed about $1,325 million under its new bank credit facility.
 
 
      The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company's common stock at
 an initial conversion rate of 6.575 shares for each $1,000 principal amount at
 maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence of specified
 events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and
 future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are not redeemable by
 the Company prior to March 25, 2003. On or after such date, the debentures are
 redeemable for cash with at least 30 days notice, at the option of the Company.
 The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option of the holder as of
 March 25, 2003, March 25, 2008 and March 25, 2013, at purchase prices equal to
 the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates. The Company may,
 at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or common stock or
 any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facility prohibits the Company
 from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. The Company was required to
 file a registration statement with the SEC to register the debentures by
 June 23, 1998. This registration statement was filed on February 4, 1999 and the
 SEC has not declared the registration statement effective. The Company's failure
 to file the registration statement by June 23, 1998 did not constitute default
 under the terms of the debentures. As part of the normal review process by the
 SEC, a number of comments have been made by the staff of the Division of
 Corporation Finance relating to the registration statement and the restated 1996
 and 1997 financial statements included therein. The Company has filed an
 amendment to this registration statement. From June 23, 1998 until the
 registration statement is declared effective, the Company is required to pay to
 the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, for each day during such
 period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% during the first 90 days and 0.50%
 thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the debentures plus the
 original issue discount thereon on such day. The Company made its first payment
 of approximately $500,000 to the debenture holders on September 25, 1998 and an
 additional $2 million was paid on March 25, 1999. An additional cash payment of
 approximately $2 million, representing the Company's liability to debenture
 holders through June 30, 1999, will be paid on September 25, 1999.
 
 
      Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its $250 million
 syndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank credit
 facility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to
 $1.7 billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required Sunbeam to
 maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge
 coverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March 31,
 1998 and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of the
 borrowings under the bank credit facility.
 
 
      As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurred during
 the first half of 1998, the Company did not achieve the specified financial
 ratios for June 30, 1998 and it appeared unlikely that the Company would achieve
 the specified financial ratios for September 30, 1998. Consequently, the Company
 and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as of June 30, 1998 that waived
 through December 31, 1998 all defaults arising from the failure of the Company
 to satisfy the specified financial ratios for June 30, 1998 and September 30,
 1998. Pursuant to an agreement with the Company dated as of October 19, 1998,
 the
 
 
                                        43
 <PAGE>
 Company's lenders extended all of the waivers under the June 30 agreement
 through April 10, 1999 and also waived through such date all defaults arising
 from any failure by the Company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for
 December 31, 1998. As part of the October 19, 1998 agreement, the Company agreed
 to a minimum monthly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
 amortization ("EBITDA") covenant for each of February, March and April of 1999,
 which covenant the Company was able to satisfy.
 
 
      On April 10, 1999, among other things, the lenders extended all of the
 waivers set forth in the October 19, 1998 agreement through April 15, 1999. On
 April 15, 1999, the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensive
 amendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all of
 the waivers under the April 10, 1999 agreement until April 10, 2000 and waived
 until such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy
 the specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during 1999
 and for March 31, 2000. As part of the April 15, 1999 amendment, the Company
 agreed to a minimum cumulative EBITDA covenant that is based on
 post-December 31, 1998 consolidated EBITDA and is tested at the end of each
 month occurring on or prior to March 31, 2000, as well as a covenant limiting
 the amount of revolving loans (other than those used to fund the Coleman merger)
 that may be outstanding under the bank credit facility as of the end of each
 such month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA was initially $6.3 million for the
 period January 1, 1999 through April 30, 1999 and generally grows on a monthly
 basis until it reaches $121 million for the period from January 1, 1999 through
 March 31, 2000. The following description of the bank credit facility reflects
 the terms of the bank credit facility as amended to date.
 
 
      The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to
 $1.7 billion through:
 
 
      o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to
        $400.0 million maturing March 30, 2005, $52.5 million of which may only
        be used to complete the Coleman merger;
 
 
      o up to $800.0 million in term loans maturing on March 30, 2005, of which
        $35.0 million may only be used to complete the Coleman merger; and
 
 
      o a $500.0 million term loan maturing September 30, 2006 (of which
        $5.0 million has already been repaid through March 31, 1999.)
 
 
 As of December 31, 1998, approximately $1.4 billion was outstanding and
 approximately $0.2 billion was available for borrowing under the bank credit
 facility. The remaining $0.1 billion of the $1.7 billion bank credit facility
 was committed for outstanding letters of credit.
 
 
      Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at Sunbeam's option:
 
      o at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"); or
 
      o at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the
        higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent
        or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%;
 
 in each case plus an interest margin which is currently 3.75% for LIBOR
 borrowings and 2.50% for base rate borrowings. The applicable interest margin is
 subject to upward or downward adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
 events.
 
 
      Under an April 15, 1999 amendment to the bank credit facility, we agreed to
 pay the bank lenders a loan commitment fee of between 0.25% to 1.00% of the
 commitments under the bank credit facility as of April 15, 1999. The percentage
 used to calculate the fee will be determined by reference to the bank lenders'
 aggregate commitments and loan exposure under the bank credit facility as they
 may be reduced on or before September 30, 2000. The fee is payable on the
 earlier of September 30, 2000 and the date the commitments are terminated and
 the loans and other amount payable under the bank credit facility are repaid.
 See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
      Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge of the
 stock of the Company's material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by a
 security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
 material domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiaries
 except as described below. Currently, Coleman's inventory and related assets are
 pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account
 under the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman's note
 payable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic
 assets, other than real property, including 66% of the stock of its direct
 foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiaries
 and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not the
 assets of Coleman's subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company's
 lending banks, to which the Coleman
 
 
                                        44
 <PAGE>
 note has been pledged as security for the Company's obligations to them. Upon
 completion of the Coleman merger, substantially all of Coleman's assets and the
 assets of Coleman's domestic subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the
 obligations under the bank credit facility.
 
 
      In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteed by a
 number of the Company's wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and these
 subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion of the
 Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries will become
 guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To the extent
 extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, the
 obligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company.
 
 
      In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bank
 credit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similar
 nature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and its
 subsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things:
 
 
      o declare dividends or repurchase stock;
 
      o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in
        sale-leaseback transactions;
 
      o make loans and investments;
 
      o incur additional debt, including revolving loans under the bank credit
        facility;
 
 
      o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive
        agreements;
 
      o make capital and Year 2000 compliance expenditures;
 
      o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;
 
      o engage in certain transactions with affiliates;
 
 
      o settle certain litigation;
 
 
      o alter its cash management system; and
 
      o alter the businesses they conduct.
 
 The Company is also required to comply with specified financial covenants and
 ratios.
 
 
      The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary for
 transactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of
 covenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising from
 compliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees and
 change of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bank
 credit facility if the Company's registration statement in connection with the
 Coleman merger is not declared effective by the SEC on or before October 30,
 1999 or if the merger does not occur within 25 business days of the
 effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash
 consideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of any
 appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customary
 fees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds $87.5 million.
 Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfy
 these conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company to
 prepay term loans under the bank credit facility on each of September 30, 1999
 and December 31, 1999 to the extent that cash on hand in the Company's
 concentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loan
 commitments on these dates (excluding, for the September 30, 1999 measurement
 date, $52.5 million reserved for the Coleman merger), exceeds $115 million and
 $125 million, respectively, but Sunbeam is not required to prepay more than
 $69.3 million in the aggregate as a result of the provision.
 
 
      Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company to satisfy
 any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank credit facility or
 the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank credit facility
 would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a 2.00% increase in the interest
 rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter of credit
 fees to 1.00% and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstanding borrowings
 under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their other rights and
 remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights and remedies would
 likely have a material adverse effect on Sunbeam.
 
 
      The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral of the
 1999 scheduled term loan payments of $69.3 million until April 10, 2000 subject
 to delivery of certain collateral documents and the filing of an amendment to
 the Company's registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Coleman merger.
 If these conditions are met, and there are no events of default, the scheduled
 loan payments will be extended until April 10, 2000. The Company anticipates
 that it will satisfy these conditions and, accordingly, has
 
 
                                        45
 <PAGE>
 classified these amounts as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See
 Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
 
 Cash Flows
 
      As of December 31, 1998, Sunbeam had cash and cash equivalents of $61.4
 million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of $427.1 million
 and total debt of $2.3 billion. Cash used in operating activities during 1998
 was $190.4 million compared to $6.0 million used in operating activities in
 1997. This change is primarily attributable to lower earnings after giving
 effect to non-cash charges partially offset by improvements in working capital.
 During 1998, $184.2 million in cash was generated by reducing receivables,
 including through the revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program
 described below, and reducing inventories, which was partially offset by a $68.2
 million reduction in accounts payable levels. In the fourth quarter of 1998,
 cash provided by operating activities totaled $34.3 million, principally due to
 cash generated by reducing receivables and inventories of $181.9 million. The
 decrease in cash provided by operations from 1996 to 1997 is primarily
 attributable to increased inventory levels in 1997 and spending in 1997 related
 to the restructuring initiatives accrued for in 1996, largely offset by an
 increase in cash generated by earnings in 1997 and an income tax refund (net of
 payments) in 1997. Cash used in operating activities reflects proceeds of $200.0
 million in 1998 and $58.9 million in 1997 from the Company's revolving trade
 accounts receivable securitization program, described below.
 
 
      Cash used in investing activities in 1998 reflects $522.4 million for the
 acquisitions. In 1997, cash provided by investing activities reflected $91.0
 million in proceeds from the sales of divested operations and other assets.
 Capital spending totaled $53.7 million in 1998 and was primarily for
 manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment and tooling for new products,
 and management information systems hardware and software licenses. The new
 product capital spending principally related to the air and water filtration
 products which were discontinued in the second quarter of 1998, electric
 blankets, grills, clippers and appliances. Capital spending in 1997 was $60.5
 million and was primarily attributable to manufacturing capacity expansion, cost
 reduction initiatives and equipment to manufacture new products. The new product
 capital spending in 1997 principally related to appliances and included costs
 related to blenders, toasters, stand mixers, slow cookers and a soft serve ice
 cream product. Capital spending in 1996 was $75.3 million, including
 $14.5 million related to the discontinued furniture business, and was primarily
 attributable to equipment for new product development and cost reduction
 initiatives. As discussed above, the Company's capital and Year 2000 compliance
 expenditures are limited under the terms of the bank credit facility.
 
 
      Cash provided by financing activities totaled $766.2 million in 1998 and
 reflects:
 
 
      o the net proceeds from the sale of debentures of $729.6 million;
 
 
      o the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the
        Company's $250 million September 1996 revolving credit facility;
 
 
      o the repayment of debt in connection with the acquisitions;
 
 
      o the early extinguishment of the $75.0 million Hattiesburg industrial
        revenue bond; and
 
 
      o net borrowings under the bank credit facility.
 
 
      In addition, cash provided by financing activities during 1998 includes
 $19.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
 
 
      During 1997, cash provided by financing activities of $16.4 million
 reflected:
 
 
      o net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company's September 1996
        revolving credit facility;
 
 
      o $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture
        business and other assets sold; and
 
 
      o $26.6 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
 
 
      During 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million
 primarily reflected:
 
 
      o revolving credit facility borrowings of $30.0 million to support working
        capital and capital spending requirements;
 
 
      o $11.5 million in new issuances of long-term debt; and
 
 
      o $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to certain
        executives of the Company.
 
 
      In December 1997, the Company entered into a revolving trade accounts
 receivable securitization program, which as amended expires in March 2000, to
 sell without recourse, through a wholly-owned
 
 
                                        46
 <PAGE>
 subsidiary, up to a maximum of $70 million in trade accounts receivable. The
 Company, as agent for the purchaser of the receivables, retains collection and
 administrative responsibilities for the purchased receivables. For the year
 ended December 31, 1998, the Company sold approximately $200 million of accounts
 receivable under this program. At December 31, 1998, the Company had reduced
 accounts receivable by $20.0 million for receivables sold under this program.
 The Company expects to continue to utilize the securitization program to finance
 a portion of its accounts receivable. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements.
 
 
      At December 31, 1998, standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated
 $82.3 million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental,
 workers' compensation, and international trade activities. In addition, as of
 December 31, 1998, surety bonds with a contract value of $26.5 million were
 outstanding largely as a result of litigation judgments that are currently under
 appeal.
 
 
      For additional information relating to the debentures, the bank credit
 facility and the repayment of debt, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated and
 Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 
      The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman in
 a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority shareholders will
 receive 0.5677 share of the Company's common stock and $6.44 in cash for each
 share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition, unexercised options
 under Coleman's stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equal
 to the difference between $27.50 and the exercise price of such options. The
 Company expects to issue approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and
 expend approximately $87 million in cash, including cash paid to option holders,
 to complete the Coleman transaction. See Note 2 and Note 15 to Consolidated
 Financial Statements. Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated that
 the Coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal 1999.
 
 
      The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility,
 cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquired
 companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable
 securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,
 capital expenditure and Year 2000 compliance spending, and debt service through
 April 10, 2000. The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an
 amendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on further
 waiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility.
 Any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be
 made based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particular
 transactions. There can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of
 existing covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by
 April 10, 2000. The failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt
 refinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants and
 compliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate
 the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility, which
 would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. Accordingly, debt
 related to the bank credit facility and all debt containing cross-default
 provisions was classified as current in the second quarter of 1999.
 
 
      In May 1998, the NYSE advised the Company that it did not meet the NYSE's
 continuing listing standards because the Company did not have tangible net
 assets of $12.0 million at December 31, 1997 and average annual net income of at
 least $0.6 million for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995. The Company
 representatives met with NYSE officials, and in March 1999, the NYSE informed
 the Company that the Company's common stock would not be delisted at that time,
 although the NYSE would, however, continue to monitor the Company's financial
 condition and operations. The NYSE subsequently advised the Company that the
 NYSE had revised its continuing listing standards, and that the Company is in
 compliance with the revised standards.
 
 
      In April 1999, the NYSE advised Coleman that it did not meet the NYSE's
 continuing listing standards because Coleman did not have tangible assets of at
 least $12.0 million at September 30, 1998 and an annual net income of at least
 $0.6 million for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995. At that time, Coleman
 requested the NYSE to continue to list the Coleman common stock until completion
 of the merger. The NYSE subsequently advised Coleman that Coleman also failed to
 satisfy certain non-financial continuing listing standards. The NYSE
 subsequently advised Coleman that the NYSE had revised its continuing listing
 standards, and that Coleman is in compliance with the revised financial
 standards. Coleman and the NYSE have agreed upon a program whereby Coleman will
 correct the deficiencies in its non-financial continuing listing standards by
 the end of 1999. Coleman is currently complying with such program. If Coleman
 were to
 
 
                                        47
 <PAGE>
 be delisted from the NYSE, it could adversely affect the market price of
 Coleman's common stock and Coleman's ability to sell its capital stock to third
 parties. However, the Company's bank credit facility currently restricts Coleman
 from taking such actions.
 
 
      By letter dated June 17, 1998, the staff of the Division of Enforcement of
 the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry into
 Sunbeam's accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Company
 produce documents. On July 2, 1998, the SEC issued a Formal Order of Private
 Investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which a
 subpoena was served on the Company requiring the production of documents. On
 November 4, 1998, the Company received another SEC subpoena requiring the
 production of additional documents. The Company has provided numerous documents
 to the SEC staff and continues to cooperate with the SEC staff. The Company has,
 however, declined to provide the SEC with material that the Company believes is
 subject to the attorney-client privilege and the work product liability. The
 Company cannot predict the term of such investigation or its potential outcome.
 
 
      The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class and
 derivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of its
 consolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbes
 warrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements, of Messrs.
 Dunlap and Kersh. The Company intends to vigorously defend each of the actions,
 but cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the
 likelihood of the Company's success in each case or the range of potential loss.
 However, if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a
 material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
 operations and cash flows. Additionally, the Company's insurance carriers have
 filed various suits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors' and
 officers' liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid and/or
 had been properly canceled by the carriers or have advised the Company of their
 intent to deny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue
 recovery from all of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or
 its indemnified officers and/or directors under any of the foregoing actions and
 to recover attorneys' fees covered under those policies. The Company's failure
 to obtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against the
 Company on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on
 the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
 
      Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs
 (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation and
 claims and related anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is both
 probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
 the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the
 Company's assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on
 the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature
 of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information
 about the plaintiffs, and other significant factors which vary by case. When it
 is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred, the Company
 evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum end of the range.
 As of December 31, 1998, the Company had established accruals for litigation
 matters of $31.2 million (representing $17.5 million and $13.7 million for
 estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively) and
 $9.9 million as of December 28, 1997, (representing $3.0 million and
 $6.9 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees,
 respectively). It is anticipated that the $31.2 million accrual will be paid as
 follows: $22.4 million in 1999, $7.5 million in 2000, and $1.3 million in 2001.
 The Company believes, based on information known to the Company on December 31,
 1998, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as of
 December 31, 1998 have been adequately reserved, to the extent determinable.
 
 
      As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the
 constant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for
 substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated
 rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could result
 in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the product
 lines the Company acquired in the 1998 acquisitions have increased its exposure
 to product liability and related claims.
 
 
      The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuits from
 time to time that the Company considers to be ordinary routine litigation
 incidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution of
 these routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individually
 or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
 position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

 Proceedings.
 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
      In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
 ("AICPA") issued Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
 Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use ("SOP 98-1"). SOP 98-1
 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be
 expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. The Company
 adopted SOP 98-1 effective January 1, 1999. Adoption of this statement did not
 have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results
 of operations, or cash flows. Actual charges incurred due to systems projects
 may be material.
 
 
      In April 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on
 the Cost of Start-up Activities ("SOP 98-5"). SOP 98-5 requires all costs
 associated with pre-opening, pre-operating and organization activities to be
 expensed as incurred. The Company adopted SOP 98-5 beginning January 1, 1999.
 Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's
 consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
 
      In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
 Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires the recognition of all
 derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities
 measured at fair value. The Company has not yet determined the impact SFAS
 No. 133 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations
 or cash flows.
 
 
 YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
 
      The following disclosure is as of May 11, 1999.
 
 
      The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year 2000 on its operations.
 Year 2000 issues could include potential problems in the information technology
 ("IT") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations and problems
 in the Company's products. Year 2000 system failures could affect routine but
 critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production, order
 processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. In addition,
 system failures could affect the Company's security, payroll operations, or
 employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potential risks from third
 parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequately address their own
 Year 2000 issues.
 
 
   Sunbeam's Approach to Year 2000 Issues
 
      While the Company's Year 2000 readiness planning has been underway for over
 one year, during the third quarter of 1998 the Company established a
 cross-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by three
 external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and
 to assist the Company in implementing its Year 2000 strategy. This team is
 headed by the Company's Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to the
 Company's Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The audit committee of the
 board of directors is advised periodically on the status of Sunbeam's Year 2000
 readiness program.
 
 
      The Year 2000 project team has developed a phased approach to identify and
 resolve Year 2000 issues with many of these activities conducted in parallel.
 The Company's approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are described
 below.
 
 
      Phase 1--Inventory and Assessment.  During the first phase of the Company's
 Year 2000 readiness program, the Company established a Year 2000 program
 management office to centralize the management of all of the Company's Year 2000
 projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide, uniform
 strategy for assessing and addressing the Year 2000 issues.
 
 
      The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software
 systems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,
 telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year 2000
 problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,
 ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into the
 Company's Year 2000 database along with a determination of the item's level of
 criticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have a
 significant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company's Year 2000
 program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. All
 information relative to each item is being tracked in the Company's Year 2000
 database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth
 
 
                                        49
 <PAGE>
 quarters of 1998. Sunbeam has completed a review of the readiness of embedded
 microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the Company's
 products have Year 2000 date sensitive systems.
 
 
      Phase 2--Correction and Testing.  The second phase of the Company's Year
 2000 readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate, as
 necessary, those items identified during Phase 1 as requiring corrective action.
 
 
      The Company relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that are
 critical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted by
 not being ready for any Year 2000 issues include, among others:
 
 
      o purchases of materials;
 
      o production management;
 
      o order entry and fulfillment;
 
      o payroll processing; and
 
      o billing and collections.
 
      Systems and applications that have been identified by the Company to date
 as not currently Year 2000 ready and which are critical to the Company's
 operations include:
 
 
      o financial software systems, which process:
 
        o order entry;
 
        o purchasing;
 
        o production management;
 
        o general ledger;
 
        o accounts receivable; and
 
        o accounts payable functions;
 
        o payroll applications; and
 
        o critical applications in the Company's manufacturing and distribution
          facilities, such as warehouse management applications.
 
 
 Recognizing how dependent the entire company is on IT, the Company decided in
 1997 to replace its primary business applications with a uniform international
 business and accounting information system to address the systems or
 applications listed above as well as to improve internal reporting processes.
 Based upon representations from the manufacturer that the current version of
 this uniform information system is Year 2000 ready, the Company has been
 actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilize this uniform system
 to the Year 2000 ready version. In addition to the pre-acquisition Sunbeam
 locations which had already utilized an earlier non-Year 2000 ready version of
 this uniform business and accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee,
 Health-o-Meter, and Sunbeam Latin America are replacing their current non-Year
 2000 ready systems with this new uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe is
 also replacing key business components with this new system.
 
 
      The Company is also actively replacing and/or upgrading a number of
 business systems that are not Year 2000 ready, including those that use
 localized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by
 the uniform business and accounting information system. For example, at Coleman
 approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs that are used in lieu of
 Sunbeam's uniform business and accounting information system have been
 remediated and tested to be Year 2000 ready. With respect to the Company's
 non-IT systems, including time and attendance, security, and in-line
 manufacturing hardware, the Company is actively analyzing these items to assess
 any Year 2000 issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and the
 Company will continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items.
 
 
      The Company has largely implemented the corrective work described above and
 expects to complete final testing and implementation of such systems in the
 third quarter and early fourth quarter of 1999.
 
 
      Phase 3--Customers, Suppliers and Business Partners.  The third phase of
 the Company's Year 2000 readiness program which was initiated during the third
 and fourth quarters of 1998 is designed to assess and interact with the
 Company's customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,
 the Company surveyed 1,100 vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did not
 provide an initial response. During the first five months of 1999, "high risk"
 vendors were contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has
 
 
                                        50
 <PAGE>
 since decreased substantially. In fact, currently only 13% of the Company's
 vendors who were surveyed are categorized as "high risk" which includes
 non-respondents. Based on the most recent responses to the survey and continued
 evaluation, the Company believes that there is only a low to a medium risk of
 Year 2000 issues for the remaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor
 the Year 2000 progress of the "high risk" vendors and will re-survey these
 companies in late August to determine the appropriate course of action.
 Furthermore, the Company is in the process of contacting alternate vendors who
 are Year 2000 ready to replace critical vendors deemed "high risk" in the event
 that these vendors are not found to be Year 2000 ready. The Company has not
 independently verified the responses of vendors and does not anticipate
 undertaking such independent verification process.
 
 
      Beginning in the second quarter of 1999, the Company began contacting its
 major customers to confirm their preparations for Year 2000 issues. Sunbeam has
 already responded to numerous customer inquiries and believes that all of the
 Company's major customers have established programs to deal with Year 2000
 issues. In order to improve the Company's communication with its customers,
 suppliers and business partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year 2000
 telephone number and is in the process of providing Year 2000 information on a
 Company web site.
 
 
      Phase 4--Contingency Planning.  This phase will involve contingency
 planning for unresolved Year 2000 issues, particularly any issues arising with
 third party suppliers. The Company's Year 2000 readiness program is ongoing and
 its ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, will
 continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. As a
 precautionary measure, the Company plans to establish a contingency plan for
 addressing any effects of the Year 2000 on its operations, whether due to the
 Company's systems or those of third parties not being ready for any Year 2000
 issues. The Company expects to substantially complete such contingency plan by
 September 30, 1999; such contingency plan will address alternative processes,
 such as manual procedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative
 service providers, and plans to address Year 2000 readiness issues as they
 arise. Such contingency plans may also require an increase in inventory during
 the second half of 1999 to protect against supply interruption.
 
 
   The Risks of Sunbeam's Year 2000 Approach
 
      The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year 2000
 readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company's approach, have
 assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest
 single component (upgrade or installation of the Company's uniform system) of
 the Company's Year 2000 program. Since the Company's Year 2000 program was
 developed and is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company
 did not engage another independent third party to verify the program's overall
 approach or total cost; based on this, the Company believes that the Company's
 exposure in this regard is mitigated. In addition, through the use of external
 third-party diagnostic software packages that are designed to analyze the Year
 2000 readiness of business software programs, the Company was able to identify
 potential Year 2000 issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it
 has also mitigated its risk by validating and verifying key program components.
 
 
      Management believes that, although there are significant systems that are
 being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accounting
 information system, the Company's information systems environment will be made
 Year 2000 ready prior to January 1, 2000. The Company's failure to timely
 complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the
 Company.
 
 
      With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failure of
 some of these third parties to become Year 2000 ready could also have a material
 adverse impact on the Company. For example, the failure of some of the Company's
 principal suppliers to have Year 2000 ready internal systems could impact the
 Company's ability to manufacture and/or ship its products or to maintain
 adequate inventory levels for production.
 
 
      At this time, the Company believes that the most likely "worst-case"
 scenario relating to Year 2000 involves potential disruptions in areas in which
 the Company's operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whose
 systems may not work properly after January 1, 2000. While such system failures
 could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Company
 and its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at present
 estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subject
 to the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third parties
 whose operations are
 
 
                                        51
 <PAGE>
 not made ready for Year 2000 issues, the impact on the Company's operations
 could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannot be developed prior to
 January 1, 2000.
 
 
      The nature and focus of the Company's efforts to address the Year 2000
 problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues
 are identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of the
 Company's efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections
 with respect to activities required in the future. These estimates and
 projections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may be
 substantial.
 
 
   The Costs to Address Sunbeam's Year 2000 Issues
 
      Through December 31, 1998 the Company had expended approximately
 $19 million to address Year 2000 issues of which approximately 50% was recorded
 as capital expenditures and the remainder as SG&A expense. The Company's current
 assessment of the total costs to address and remedy Year 2000 issues and enhance
 its operating systems, including costs for the acquired companies, is
 approximately $60 million.
 
 
      This estimate includes the following categories:
 
 
 <TABLE>
 <S>                                                                                               <C>
 o uniform international business and accounting system                                            $40 million
 
 o localized business system software upgrades and remediation                                     $ 9 million
 
 o Year 2000 readiness assessment and tracking                                                     $ 6 million
 
 o upgrade of personal computers and related software                                              $ 5 million
 </TABLE>
 
 
      The amount to be incurred for Year 2000 issues during 1999 of approximately
 $41 million represents over 50% of the Company's total 1999 budget for
 information systems and related support, including Year 2000 costs. A large
 majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that will
 not recur in the Year 2000 or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to third
 party consultants, who are involved in the program management office as well as
 the modification and replacement of software, represent approximately 75% of the
 total estimated cost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily
 to software license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated
 with company employees. The Company expects these expenditures to be financed
 through operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion
 of these expenditures will enhance the Company's operating systems in addition
 to resolving the Year 2000 issues. As the Company completes its assessment of
 the Year 2000 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may
 differ materially from the amounts shown above. The bank credit facility does
 not permit the Company to spend more than $50 million on Year 2000 testing and
 remediation during 1999.
 
 
      Because Year 2000 readiness is critical to the business, the Company has
 redeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year
 2000 issues. In addition, due to the importance of IT systems to the Company's
 business, management has deferred non-critical systems enhancements as much as
 possible. The Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have
 a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or
 cash flows.
 
 
 EFFECTS OF INFLATION
 
      For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 the
 Company's cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable. To
 the extent possible, the Company's objective is to offset the impact of
 inflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and price
 increases.

        expenses and costs of product recalls;
 
      o weather conditions which can have an unfavorable impact upon sales of
        certain of Sunbeam's products;
 
 
      o the numerous lawsuits against the Company and the SEC investigation into
        Sunbeam's accounting practices and policies, and uncertainty regarding
        Sunbeam's available coverage on its directors' and officers' liability
        insurance;
 
 
      o the possibility of a recession in the United States or other countries
        resulting in a decrease in consumer demands for the Company's products;
 
 
      o actions by competitors including business combinations, new product
        offerings and promotional activities; and
 
 
      o failure of the Company and/or its suppliers of goods or services to
        timely complete the remediation of computer systems to effectively
        process Year 2000 information.
