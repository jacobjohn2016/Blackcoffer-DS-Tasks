         OF OPERATIONS
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2001
 
 SUMMARY AMR Corporation's (AMR or the Company) NET LOSS during the second
 quarter of 2002 was $495 million, or $3.19 per share, as compared to a net loss
 of $507 million, or $3.29 per share for the same period in 2001. AMR's OPERATING
 LOSS of $601 million decreased by $159 million compared to the same period in
 2001. The Company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the
 September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and
 the air transportation industry. On April 9, 2001, Trans World Airlines LLC (TWA
 LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR) purchased substantially all of the assets
 and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).
 Accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC are included in the accompanying
 condensed consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended
 June 30, 2002 whereas for 2001 the results of TWA LLC were included only for the
 period April 10, 2001 through June 30, 2001. All references to American
 Airlines, Inc. include the operations of TWA LLC since April 10, 2001
 (collectively, American). AMR's second quarter 2001 results include: (i) a $685
 million charge ($430 million after-tax, or $2.79 per share) related to the
 writedown of the carrying value of its Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft
 and related rotables in accordance with SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
 of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (see footnote
 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), and (ii) a $45 million
 gain ($29 million after-tax, or $0.19 per share) from the settlement of a legal
 matter related to the Company's 1999 labor disruption.
 
 Although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity
 since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's second quarter 2002
 revenues were down significantly quarter-over-quarter. In addition to the
 residual effects of September 11, the Company's revenues continue to be
 negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel
 declines, the geographic distribution of the Company's network and reduced
 fares. In total, the Company's REVENUES decreased $1,104 million, or 19.8
 percent, in the second quarter of 2002 as compared to the same period last year.
 American's PASSENGER REVENUES decreased by 19.3 percent, or $898 million in the
 second quarter of 2002 from the same period in 2001. American's domestic revenue
 per available seat mile (RASM) decreased 11.9 percent, to 8.47 cents, on a
 capacity decrease of 8 percent, to 32 billion available seat miles (ASMs).
 International RASM decreased to 8.67 cents, or 5 percent, on a capacity decrease
 of 16.2 percent. The decrease in international RASM was due to an 8.6 percent
 and 3.1 percent decrease in Latin American and European RASM, respectively,
 slightly offset by a 3.2 percent increase in Pacific RASM. The decrease in
 international capacity was driven by a 33.9 percent, 16.2 percent and 12.3
 percent reduction in Pacific, European and Latin American ASMs, respectively.
 
 AMR Eagle's PASSENGER REVENUES decreased 15.9 percent, or $65 million. AMR
 Eagle's traffic increased 2.8 percent while capacity decreased 5 percent, to
 approximately 1.6 billion ASMs. As with American, the decrease in AMR Eagle's
 revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the September 11, 2001
 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown.
 
 Cargo REVENUES decreased $48 million, or 25.3 percent, primarily due to the same
 reasons as noted above.
 
 OTHER REVENUES decreased 27.4 percent, or $93 million, due primarily to
 decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for other
 airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service
 charges.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
 The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES decreased 19.9 percent, or $1,263 million.
 American's COST PER ASM increased 0.5 percent to 10.78 cents, excluding the
 impact of the second quarter 2001 asset impairment charge. WAGES, SALARIES AND
 BENEFITS remained flat quarter-over-quarter, reflecting (i) a decrease in the
 average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher salaries, and
 (ii) increases in the Company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter
 reflecting rapidly rising medical care and prescription drug costs. AIRCRAFT
 FUEL expense decreased 22.1 percent, or $186 million, due primarily to an 11.6
 percent decrease in the Company's fuel consumption and a 9.4 percent decrease in
 the Company's average price per gallon of fuel. FOOD SERVICE decreased 17.4
 percent, or $38 million, due primarily to the Company's reduced operating
 schedule and change in level of food service. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS decreased
 40.4 percent, or $105 million, due primarily to a 19.1 percent decrease in
 passenger revenues and commission structure changes implemented in March 2002.
 SPECIAL CHARGES of $685 million related to the writedown of the carrying value
 of the Company's Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables
 during the second quarter of 2001 (see footnote 8 to the condensed consolidated
 financial statements). OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES decreased 19.3 percent, or $196
 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that American
 performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs,
 credit card and booking fees, advertising and promotion costs, and data
 processing expenses, which were partially offset by higher insurance and
 security costs.
 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) increased $86 million due to the following: INTEREST
 INCOME decreased 25 percent, or $6 million, due primarily to decreases in
 interest rates. INTEREST EXPENSE increased $32 million, or 24.2 percent,
 resulting primarily from the increase in the Company's long-term debt. INTEREST
 CAPITALIZED decreased $16 million, or 42.1 percent, due primarily to a decrease
 in purchase deposits for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS-NET decreased 86.5
 percent, or $32 million, due primarily to a $45 million gain recorded during the
 second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the
 Company's 1999 labor disruption.
 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2002 was impacted by
 a $30 million charge resulting from a provision in Congress' economic stimulus
 package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs).
 This change allows the Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years,
 rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the Company to more
 quickly recover its NOLs. The extended NOL carryback did however, result in the
 displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. These credits are now
 expected to expire before being utilized by the Company, resulting in this
 charge.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2001
 
 SUMMARY AMR's LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE for the six
 months ended June 30, 2002 was $1,070 million, or $6.90 per share, as compared
 to a net loss of $550 million, or $3.58 per share, for the same period in 2001.
 AMR's OPERATING LOSS for the six months ended June 30, 2002 was $1,330 million,
 compared to an operating loss of $764 million for the same period in 2001. The
 Company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the September 11,
 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the air
 transportation industry. On April 9, 2001, TWA LLC purchased substantially all
 of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of TWA. Accordingly, the operating
 results of TWA LLC are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the six month period ended June 30, 2002 whereas for
 2001 the results of TWA LLC were included only for the period April 10, 2001
 through June 30, 2001. In addition, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash
 charge of $988 million (net of tax), reflected as a cumulative effect of
 accounting change, to write-off all of AMR's goodwill. AMR's 2001 results
 include: (i) a $685 million charge ($430 million after-tax, or $2.79 per share)
 related to the writedown of the carrying value of its Fokker 100, Saab 340 and
 ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables, and (ii) a $45 million gain ($29 million
 after-tax, or $0.19 per share) from the settlement of a legal matter related to
 the Company's 1999 labor disruption.
 
 Although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity
 since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's 2002 revenues were down
 significantly year-over-year. In addition to the residual effects of September
 11, the Company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic
 slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines, the geographic distribution
 of the Company's network and reduced fares. In total, the Company's REVENUES
 decreased $1,728 million, or 16.7 percent, in 2002 versus the same period in
 2001. American's PASSENGER REVENUES decreased by 15.7 percent, or $1,349 million
 in 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001. American's domestic RASM
 decreased 13.4 percent, to 8.58 cents, on a capacity decrease of 0.4 percent, to
 61.3 billion ASMs. International RASM decreased to 8.67 cents, or 7.7 percent,
 on a capacity decrease of 14 percent. The decrease in international RASM was due
 to a 10.2 percent and 7.9 percent decrease in Latin American and European RASM,
 respectively, slightly offset by a 5.6 percent increase in Pacific RASM. The
 decrease in international capacity was driven by a 36.4 percent, 15.2 percent
 and 8.2 percent reduction in Pacific, European and Latin American ASMs,
 respectively.
 
 AMR Eagle's PASSENGER REVENUES decreased 14.9 percent, or $114 million. AMR
 Eagle's traffic increased 4.7 percent while capacity decreased 3.2 percent, to
 approximately 3.2 billion ASMs. As with American, the decrease in AMR Eagle's
 revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the September 11, 2001
 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown.
 
 Cargo REVENUES decreased $90 million, or 24.6 percent, primarily due to the same
 reasons as noted above.
 
 OTHER REVENUES decreased 27.6 percent, or $175 million, due primarily to
 decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for other
 airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service
 charges.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
 
 The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES decreased 10.5 percent, or approximately $1,162
 million. American's COST PER ASM increased by 0.5 percent to 11.03 cents,
 excluding the impact of the second quarter 2001 asset impairment charge. WAGES,
 SALARIES AND BENEFITS increased 8.6 percent, or $334 million, reflecting (i) a
 decrease in the average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by
 higher salaries, and (ii) increases in the Company's pension and health
 insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and
 prescription drug costs. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense decreased 23.6 percent, or $366
 million, due primarily to a 16.1 percent decrease in the Company's average price
 per gallon of fuel and a 6.1 percent decrease in the Company's fuel consumption.
 AIRCRAFT RENTALS increased $66 million, or 17.6 percent, due primarily the
 addition of TWA aircraft. FOOD SERVICE decreased 12.9 percent, or $52 million,
 due primarily to the Company's reduced operating schedule and change in level of
 food service. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS decreased 34.7 percent, or $168 million, due
 primarily to a 15.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission
 structure changes implemented in March 2002. SPECIAL CHARGES of $685 million
 related to the writedown of the carrying value of the Company's Fokker 100, Saab
 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables during the second quarter of 2001.
 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES decreased 15.4 percent, or $296 million, due primarily
 to decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs for other
 airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and booking
 fees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which were
 partially offset by higher insurance and security costs.
 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) increased $167 million due to the following: INTEREST
 INCOME decreased 43.8 percent, or $28 million, due primarily to decreases in
 interest rates. INTEREST EXPENSE increased $79 million, or 31.5 percent,
 resulting primarily from the increase in the Company's long-term debt. INTEREST
 CAPITALIZED decreased $35 million, or 44.3 percent, due primarily to a decrease
 in purchase deposits for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS-NET decreased $25
 million due primarily to a $45 million gain recorded during the second quarter
 of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the Company's 1999
 labor disruption and the write-down of certain investments held by the Company
 during the first quarter of 2001.
 
 The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2002 was impacted by a
 $57 million charge resulting from a provision in Congress' economic stimulus
 package that changes the period for carrybacks of NOLs. This change allows the
 Company to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than two years
 under the existing law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs.
 The extended NOL carryback did however, result in the displacement of foreign
 tax credits taken in prior years. These credits are now expected to expire
 before being utilized by the Company, resulting in this charge.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES in the six month period ended June 30,
 2002 was $86 million, a decrease of $799 million over the same period in 2001,
 due primarily to an increase in the Company's net loss. Included in net cash
 provided by operating activities during the first six months of 2002 was
 approximately $658 million received by the Company as a result of the
 utilization of its 2001 NOL's. Capital expenditures for the first six months of
 2002 were $1,113 million, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing 757-200s,
 three Boeing 777-200ERs, 15 Embraer 140s and four Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft.
 These capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and
 debt agreements. Proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of $162
 million include the proceeds received upon delivery of three McDonnell Douglas
 MD-11 aircraft to FedEx.
 
 As of June 30, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire the following
 aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 11 Boeing 777-200ERs, nine Boeing 767-300ERs, 109
 Embraer regional jets and 20 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries of these aircraft
 are scheduled to continue through 2008. Payments for these aircraft are expected
 to be approximately $505 million during the remainder of 2002, $1.5 billion in
 2003, $1.1 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $2.1 billion in
 2005 through 2008.
 
 In June 2002, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of AMR and
 American, and the credit ratings of a number of other major airlines. The
 long-term credit ratings of AMR and American were removed from Standard & Poor's
 Credit Watch with negative implications and were given a negative outlook. Any
 additional reductions in AMR's or American's credit ratings could result in
 increased borrowing costs to the Company and might limit the availability of
 future financing needs.

 In addition to the Company's approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term
 investments as of June 30, 2002, the Company has available a variety of future
 financing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) the receipt of the
 remainder of the U.S. Government grant authorized by the Air Transportation
 Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act), which is estimated to be in
 excess of $40 million, (ii) additional secured aircraft debt, (iii) the
 availability of the Company's $1 billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leaseback
 transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, (v) the
 recovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision in the
 recently passed economic stimulus package regarding NOL carrybacks, (vi)
 tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities, (vii) securitization of future
 operating receipts, and (viii) unsecured borrowings. No assurance can be given
 that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to the
 Company. However, the Company believes it will meet its current financing needs.
 
 Pursuant to the Act, the Government made available to air carriers, subject to
 certain conditions, up to $10 billion in federal government guarantees of
 certain loans. American did not seek such loan guarantees.
 
 OTHER INFORMATION
 
 As a result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
 significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to
 commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or
 passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events
 (war-risk coverage). At the same time, they significantly increased the premiums
 for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. Pursuant to
 authority granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial
 war-risk insurance until August 17, 2002 with a third party liability policy to
 cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable 60-day
 periods. In the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount of
 insurance coverage available or the Government fails to renew war-risk
 insurance, the Company's operations and/or financial position, results of
 operations or cash flows would be adversely impacted.
 
 As discussed in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, a provision in the current Allied
 Pilots Association (APA) contract freezes the number of ASMs and block hours
 flown on American's two letter marketing code by American's regional carrier
 partners when American pilots are on furlough (the ASM cap). As AMR Eagle
 continues to accept previously ordered regional jets, this ASM cap would be
 reached sometime in 2002, necessitating actions to insure compliance with the
 ASM cap. American is working with its regional partners to accomplish this.
 Actions currently being taken and considered by AMR Eagle to reduce its capacity
 are discussed in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K. In addition, American is removing
 its code from flights of the AmericanConnection carriers, which are independent
 carriers that provide feed to American's St. Louis hub. American believes that
 the combination of these actions will enable it to comply with this ASM cap
 through 2002 and for sometime beyond.
 
 In addition, another provision in the current APA contract limits the total
 number of regional jets with more than 44 seats flown under the American code by
 American's regional carrier partners to 67 aircraft. Similar to the above, as
 AMR Eagle continues to accept previously ordered Bombardier CRJ aircraft, this
 cap would be reached in early 2003. In order to ensure American remains in
 compliance with this provision, AMR Eagle has reached an agreement in principle
 to dispose of 14 Embraer 145 aircraft. Ultimately, these airplanes will be
 acquired by Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection carrier. Trans States
 Airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letter airline code and
 expects to deploy these aircraft at its St. Louis hub where it feeds American.
 The potential transaction still requires the consent of certain third parties,
 including the companies financing these aircraft, and is subject to the
 negotiation of final documentation.

 OUTLOOK
 
 Capacity for American is expected to be down approximately two percent in the
 third quarter of 2002 compared to last year's third quarter levels. AMR Eagle's
 third quarter capacity will be down about one percent from last year's levels.
 For the third quarter of 2002, the Company expects traffic to be about flat as
 compared to last year's third quarter levels. Pressure to reduce costs will
 continue, although the Company will continue to see higher benefit and security
 costs, increased insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. However, the
 Company expects to see a slight decrease in fuel prices as compared to the third
 quarter of 2001 and the continued decline in commission expense due to the
 commission changes implemented earlier in 2002. In total, American's unit costs,
 excluding special charges, for the third quarter of 2002 are expected to be down
 approximately 3.5 percent from last year's third quarter level. Notwithstanding
 the expected decrease in unit costs however, given the revenue pressures seen in
 the first half of the year and expected to continue into the third quarter, the
 Company expects to incur a sizable loss in the third quarter and a significant
 loss for 2002.
 
 In response to these financial challenges, the Company has undertaken a
 comprehensive review of its business to better align its cost structure with the
 current revenue environment, aimed at improving productivity, simplifying
 operations and reducing costs. The Company has begun to implement certain of
 these changes, including a fleet simplification program, adjustments to its
 operating schedule and increased airport automation, and will continue to refine
 its business throughout the coming months.
