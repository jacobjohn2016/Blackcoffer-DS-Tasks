         OF OPERATIONS
  
 OVERVIEW
  
      The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of nationally
 branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in
 the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products industry. The
 Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, file
 folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products. Through its
 Ampad division, the Company is among the largest suppliers of pads and other
 paper-based writing products, filing supplies, machine papers and retail
 envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing office products
 distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is the leading
 supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business envelopes to paper
 merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its future operating
 results will not be directly comparable to its historical operating results
 because of its strategic acquisitions. The Company's business has not generally
 been seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may affect
 prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.
  
      Strategic Acquisitions. On October 31, 1995, the Company acquired
 Williamhouse, a leading supplier of envelopes to many of the largest and fastest
 growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price (including assumption of
 debt) of approximately $300.7 million plus reimbursement of certain expenses to
 the sellers. On June 28, 1996, the Company acquired Niagara, a national supplier
 of envelopes to fast growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price of
 approximately $53.2 million, including costs of the acquisition and a $5 million
 one year consulting agreement with Niagara's former president. With these
 acquisitions, the Company became the largest supplier of envelopes to the
 national paper merchants. The Williamhouse acquisition was financed through the
 Company's old bank credit agreement and the assumption of senior subordinated
 notes. The Niagara acquisition was financed with proceeds from the sale of the
 Personalizing Division of Williamhouse.
  
      On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired Shade/Allied, a national
 supplier of machine papers, principally continuous computer forms. The purchase
 price of $50.7 million was financed with borrowings under the Company's bank
 credit agreement. Shade/Allied's products are distributed by both the Ampad and
 Williamhouse divisions and the manufacturing plants are integrated into the
 Ampad division. This acquisition provided the Company with a more significant
 position in a fourth product category.
  
      On August 16, 1995, the Company acquired the file folder and hanging file
 product lines of Atapco's Globe-Weis office products division. Atapco was one of
 the leading providers of file folders and hanging files to office products
 superstores. The aggregate acquisition consideration of $20.0 million, including
 fees and expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt and seller
 notes. The Globe-Weis acquisition further strengthened the Company's position in
 the filing supplies and writing products categories.
  
      Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been accounted
 for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have currently
 affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of operations in
 certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs (including
 assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair
 market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase price result in
 an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such as property,
 plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, which results in
 incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each year.
  
      Raw Material. The Company's principal raw material is paper. Certain
 commodity grades utilized by the Company have shown considerable price
 volatility since 1992. This volatility negatively impacted the Company's
 earnings in 1994 as a result of the Company's inability to implement price
 changes in many of its product lines without giving its customers advance
 notification. Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted new pricing
 policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the Company's cost of
 paper at the time of shipment. From May 1997 through October 1997, all but one
 of the key commodity grades of paper utilized by the Company increased in cost
 between 6% and 18%. Due to strategic customer considerations and competitive
 market conditions, the Company did not begin to recover a significant portion of
 the increases in paper costs affecting both its divisions until December 1997.
 The Company continued to
  
                                        23
 <PAGE>   16
  
 implement sales pricing increases during the first quarter of 1998. Paper price
 volatility is expected to continue to have an effect on net sales and cost of
 sales and there is no assurance that the Company will not be materially affected
 by future fluctuations in the price of paper. Fluctuations in paper prices can
 have an effect on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations and
 financial condition of the Company.
  
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
  
      The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
 operations as a percentage of net sales for each year in the three year period
 ended December 31, 1997. The Company's historical results of operations for each
 of these periods are significantly affected by the results for the following
 businesses acquired by the Company: (i) the results of Globe-Weiss which was
 acquired August 16, 1995; (ii) Williamhouse which was acquired on October 31,
 1995; (iii) Niagara which was acquired on June 28, 1996; and (iv) Shade/Allied
 which was acquired on February 11, 1997.

 </TABLE>
  
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996
  
      Net sales increased from $583.9 million in 1996 to $687.3 million in 1997,
 an increase of $103.4 or 17.7%. Of this sales increase, $67.4 million is due to
 the acquisition of Shade/Allied and $50.1 million is due to the inclusion of a
 full year of sales from the acquisition of Niagara. Excluding sales generated by
 the Shade/Allied and Niagara acquisitions, sales from the Ampad division
 increased $14.6 million and sales from the Williamhouse division declined $28.5
 million. The increase in sales from the Ampad division is due primarily to
 increased sales volume with the office products superstores and mass market
 retail customers. The sales decline for the Williamhouse division is primarily
 due to lower average selling prices in 1997 due to competitive market conditions
 during the year and partly to lower volumes of envelopes sold.
  
      Gross profit decreased from $125.4 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 1996
 to $96.9 million, or 14.1% of net sales, in 1997. This $28.5 million decrease is
 primarily due to increased paper, material and labor costs which the Company did
 not recover. During 1997, the Company's gross profit in the Ampad division was
 negatively affected by sales price incentives provided to the division's rapidly
 growing office superstores and mass merchants. Additionally, the Company's gross
 profit in the Williamhouse division was negatively affected by competitive
 market sales pricing conditions. These factors combined with higher material and
 labor costs led to significantly lower gross profit in 1997 than in 1996. During
 1997, the Company incurred approximately $2.8 million in one-time costs relating
 to training personnel on new equipment, the training
  
                                        24
 <PAGE>   17
  
 time needed to expand to 24 hour 7 day shifts and the move to the new Salt Lake
 facility. Additionally, the Company incurred $1.2 million in fixed costs in 1997
 for former Shade/Allied and Williamhouse plants which were closed during 1997
 and will not recur in 1998.
  
      During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company announced that it would
 incur additional charges due to annual revisions to the LIFO reserve and
 revisions to cost of sales estimates primarily for the Williamhouse division.
 These revisions resulted in $13.4 million of additional operating costs. Such
 revisions for the Williamhouse division reflected the effects of higher paper
 costs.
  
      Selling and marketing expenses increased from $17.0 million in 1996 to
 $21.9 million in 1997, or $4.9 million. Of this increase, $1.1 million is
 attributable to the acquisition of Shade/Allied and the retention of a portion
 of their sales force and customer service personnel and $3.1 million is
 primarily attributable to the Niagara acquisition and the integration of its
 sales force and customer service personnel into the Williamhouse division. The
 remainder of the increase is attributable to the Ampad division, primarily due
 to increased sales commissions associated with higher sales.
  
      General and administrative expenses increased from $24.4 million in 1996 to
 $27.5 million in 1997, or $3.1 million. Of this increase, $0.8 million is
 attributable to the acquisition of Shade/Allied and the remainder is
 attributable to increases in corporate expenses associated with the
 centralization of certain functions in Dallas. During 1997, the Company incurred
 $2.2 million of expenses related to Shade/Allied which will not recur in 1998.
  
      Losses on sales of accounts receivable increased from $1.8 million in 1996
 to $3.0 million in 1997 due to a higher average level of accounts receivable
 sold to the third party trust during 1997. Following the acquisition of Niagara
 in June 1996, the maximum amount of accounts receivable which the Company could
 sell to the third party trust at any point in time was raised from $45 million
 to $60 million. During 1997, the average level of accounts receivable sold to
 the trust was higher than in 1996 and, as a result the losses on sales of
 accounts receivable were higher. The losses on sales of accounts receivable
 represent the Company's cost of using the third party trust to provide off
 balance sheet financing of trade accounts receivable.
  
      Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense increased from $4.5
 million in 1996 to $6.1 million in 1997, an increase of $1.6 million, due
 primarily to a full year of amortization of goodwill associated with the
 acquisition of Niagara and ten and one-half months of amortization of goodwill
 associated with the acquisition of Shade/Allied.
  
      Management fees and services expense for the year ended December 31, 1996
 amounted to $3.9 million as compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December
 31, 1997. The change in management fees is due primarily to the capitalization
 of $0.8 million in Bain Capital fees in 1996 related to the acquisition of
 Shade/ Allied.
  
      Interest expense decreased from $43.0 million in 1996 to $37.8 million in
 1997, representing a decrease of $5.2 million. Such decrease was due primarily
 to the refinancing of the Company's credit agreement in July 1996, which
 resulted in lower effective interest rates generating an interest savings of
 $5.1 million, and the repayment of $70.0 million in senior subordinated notes in
 August 1996, which led to an interest expense reduction of approximately $5.5
 million. These savings were offset by $3.4 million additional interest expense
 due to increases in long-term debt associated with the acquisition of
 Shade/Allied and approximately $2.5 million additional interest expense as a
 result of the Company's investment in working capital and net increase in
 capital expenditures.
  
      The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1997 reflects an
 effective income tax provision rate of 16.7% as compared with the effective
 income tax rate of 43.2% for the year ended December 31, 1996. In 1997, the
 Company's loss before income taxes was relatively low, $3.8 million, in
 comparison to the amount of expenses which are not deductible, $5.4 million.
 Such expenses primarily consist of goodwill amortization, certain travel and
 entertainment costs and life insurance for certain current and former employees.
 As a result, the Company has taxable income for tax reporting purposes versus a
 loss for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, the Company has incurred a
 tax provision for 1997. The Company
  
                                        25
 <PAGE>   18
  
 paid $4.5 million in income taxes during 1997, received an income tax refund of
 $3.3 million in January 1998 and expects a refund of $0.8 million in state
 income taxes during the second half of 1998.
  
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
  
      Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $326.7 million,
 or 127.0%, to $583.9 million from $257.2 million for the year ended December 31,
 1995. Of this net sales increase, $274.8 million is related to the acquisition
 of Williamhouse and Niagara and $35.2 million is related to the acquisition of
 Globe-Weis. Ampad division net sales increased by $16.7 million during 1996
 compared to 1995 due to higher sales to the fast growing customer channels such
 as superstores, mass merchant stores and contract stationers.
  
      Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $77.9
 million, or 164.0%, to $125.4 million from $47.5 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1995. Approximately $69.5 million of the increase in gross profit
 is attributable to the acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara. Gross profit
 margin increased to 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 1996 from 18.5% for
 the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in gross profit margin is
 primarily attributable to higher margins of the Williamhouse division.
  
      Selling and marketing expenses increased from $6.3 million in 1995 to $17.0
 million in 1996, an increase of $10.7 million. Of this increase, $9.1 million is
 due to the acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara and $1.6 million is due to
 increased selling and marketing expense for the Ampad division resulting from a
 higher level of sales in this division.
  
      General and administrative expenses increased from $10.4 million in 1995 to
 $24.4 million in 1996, an increase of $14.0 million. Of this increase, $8.5
 million is associated with the acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara. The
 remainder is associated with the implementation of a corporate infrastructure as
 the Company expanded in size.
  
      Goodwill and intangible asset amortization increased from $0.9 million in
 1995 to $4.5 million in 1996, or an increase of $3.6 million, as a result of the
 acquisitions of Williamhouse in October 1995 and Niagara in June 1996.
  
      Losses on sales of accounts receivable increased from $0.4 million to $1.8
 million in 1996 due primarily to having the accounts receivable securitization
 facility in place for a full year in 1996. Such charge represents the losses on
 sales of trade accounts receivable from the Company to a third party trust and
 represents the cost to the Company of using an off balance sheet financing
 facility for trade accounts receivable.
  
      Management fees and services increased $3.3 million in 1996 due to the
 amortization of a consulting agreement with a former shareholder of Niagara and
 an increase in Bain Capital's management fees.
  
      Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased $29.3
 million to $43.0 million from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31,
 1995. The increase is attributable primarily to higher levels of outstanding
 debt for a full year as a result of the acquisition of Williamhouse and
 Globe-Weis. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction
 of approximately $3.4 million in interest expense following the redemption of
 $70.0 million of the senior subordinated notes in August 1996.
  
      The income tax provision for year ended December 31, 1996 reflects an
 effective tax rate of 43.2% versus an effective tax benefit rate of 56.5% for
 the year ended December 31, 1995. The effective tax rate for 1996 reflects a 40%
 combined statutory federal and state income tax rate adjusted for nondeductible
 expenses, primarily goodwill amortization. The effective tax rate for the year
 ended December 31, 1995 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of
 35% due to state income taxes and the reversal of a valuation allowance on
 deferred tax assets relating to the realizability of the Company's net operating
 loss carryforward.
  
      Extraordinary item in 1996 represents an after tax loss on extinguishment
 of debt of $20.0 million ($33.0 million pretax) recognized as a result of the
 redemption of $70.0 million of senior subordinated notes with a portion of the
 net proceeds from the initial public offering and the write off of a portion of
 the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Notes and all of the
 deferred financing costs associated with the old bank credit agreement and the
 old accounts receivable facility.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
  
      Cash used by operating activities in 1997 amounted to $62.4 million and
 consisted of (i) cash generated from the net loss, after adding back non-cash
 charges of $21.1 million, (ii) cash used to fund increases in accounts
 receivable of $17.3 million relating to higher sales in 1997 than in 1996.,
 (iii) cash used to fund increases in inventories of $44.2 million manufactured
 in anticipation of higher sales (iv) an increase in accounts payable of $4.6
 million and (v) a decrease in accrued expenses of $22.0 million due primarily to
 changes in acquisition integration cost reserves ($8.2 million), reduced
 incentive compensation due to payment of bonuses earned in 1996 and no bonus
 compensation for 1997 ($4.6 million) and reductions in customer incentive
 liabilities due to the timing of the payments to customers ($8.5 million).
 Charges to the acquisition integration cost reserves consisted primarily of
 plant closing, lease termination and severance costs associated with facilities
 which have been closed and consolidated into the Company's existing operations.
 Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 was
 $23.2 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $4.7 million
 for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in cash provided by operating
 activities is primarily due to higher net sales and earnings of the Company in
 1996. The net cash provided for the year ended December 31, 1995 resulted
 primarily from an increase of $5.0 million in accounts payable, an increase in
 accrued expenses of $4.9 million, a decrease in inventories and increased
 margins on sales.
  
      Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1997 was
 due to the acquisition of Shade/Allied for $50.7 million and purchases of
 property and equipment for $23.1 million, offset by proceeds from sales of
 equipment and a closed plant for $4.1 million. Cash used in investing activities
 for the year ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $16.2 million and $131.3
 million, respectively. The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 1996 was
 principally due to the Niagara acquisition ($53.0 million, net of cash received)
 and purchases of equipment ($14.6 million), offset by proceeds from the sale of
 the Regency Division and other assets held for sale ($49.3 million). The use of
 cash for the year ended December 31, 1995, was due to the Williamhouse
 acquisition ($122.7 million), the Globe-Weis acquisition ($7.0 million) and
 purchase of equipment ($3.9 million).
  
      Cash was provided by financing activities in 1997 by increased borrowing
 under the Company's revolving credit agreement of $130.4 million offset by $2.3
 million in payments on industrial revenue bonds and capitalized lease
 obligations. At the end of 1997, the Company had sold an additional $6 million
 of accounts receivable to the third party trust. Cash used in financing
 activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 was $23.0 million as compared to
 a cash provision from financing activities of $144.9 million for the year ended
 December 31, 1995. During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company (i)
 completed its initial public offering of 12.5 million shares of common stock for
 $172.8 million in net proceeds after deducting offering fees and expenses, (ii)
 refinanced its accounts receivable facility with a new $60.0 million facility,
 (iii) refinanced its bank credit agreement, (iv) redeemed $70.0 million of
 senior subordinated notes, (v) repaid $95.8 million of debt incurred under the
 old bank credit agreement, (vi) paid $7.7 million in redemption premiums on the
 Notes, (vii) repaid $10 million under the new accounts receivable facility with
 proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division, (viii) borrowed $54 million
 under the new accounts receivable facility and (ix) repaid WR seller notes for
 $25 million Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December
 31, 1995 was $144.9 million primarily due to periodic financings incurred in
 connection with the various acquisitions.
  
      In February 1998, the Company and its banking group agreed to an increase
 in the size of the revolving credit agreement from $300.0 million to $330.0
 million for a period of one year. After such time, the level of debt available
 under such credit agreement will be reduced to $300.0 million. In December 1997
 and February 1998, certain covenants in the credit agreement were also modified
 at the end of 1997 and for a one year period ending in February 1999. The
 Company will not be subject to a consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio until the
 first quarter of 1999. Interest coverage ratios will be measured quarterly
 beginning January 1, 1998. Unless approved by the banking group, the Company
 will be restricted to $15.0 million in net capital expenditures for 1998 and
 will be restricted from any acquisitions. The interest cost incurred by the
 Company will vary each quarter in 1998 depending on the Company's consolidated
 debt to EBITDA ratio at the beginning of each quarter. The Company paid a fee of
 $1.1 million to its banking group as part of the amendment to the credit
 agreement.
                                        27
 <PAGE>   20
  
      The ability of the Company to "comply with the covenants in the credit
 agreement," meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be
 dependent upon the future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which,
 in turn, will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial,
 business and other factors, including factors beyond the Company's control. "The
 operating results for the month of January 1998 were lower than management's
 expectations due to the timing of the implementation of price increases and
 product line rationalization. As a result, the Company is uncertain whether its
 operating performance for the first quarter of 1998 will be in full compliance
 with covenants in its credit agreement. In the event the Company does not meet
 the covenants, the Company will need to seek waiver from its banking group. A
 portion of the consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at floating
 rates; therefore, its financial condition is and will continue to be affected by
 changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into an interest
 rate protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.
  
      Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
 anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
 available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement
 and the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at December 31,
 1997 of $4.9 million, will be adequate for 1998 to make required payments of
 principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated
 capital expenditures of $13 million in 1998, and to meet working capital
 requirements.
  
      The amount of debt available under the Company's current credit agreement
 decreases by $30.0 million in February 1999 and by an additional $50.0 million
 in July 1999. Based on the Company's current level of operating results and the
 expected operating results in 1998 and 1999, the Company expects that the
 reduction of $30.0 million in February 1999 will not have a significant effect
 on its operations. However, the reduction in available borrowing of $50.0
 million at the end of 1999 may require the Company to explore other financing
 alternatives, including but not limited to a refinancing of its bank debt,
 raising new private or public debt, raising additional public equity capital,
 reducing the level of capital expenditures, reducing operating costs and selling
 certain assets. In the event that the Company is not able to successfully
 complete the financing alternatives just described, the Company and its banking
 group would be required to negotiate revisions to the terms of the credit
 agreement.
  
 INFLATION
  
      The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
 results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December
 31, 1997.
  
 NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
  
      During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company adopted Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share ("SFAS 128"). Such
 adoption resulted in a new presentation of earnings per share amounts as either
 "basic" or "diluted." Basic earnings per share is calculated as net income
 divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings
 per share is calculated in a manner similar to the "primary" earnings per share
 previously presented by the Company. Diluted earnings per share is calculated as
 net income divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, as
 adjusted for common stock options. The Company has restated its quarterly
 earnings per share to present such information in accordance with the new
 accounting standard.
  
      In February 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
 Accounting Bulletin No. 98 ("SAB 98") which requires the Company to present
 historical earnings per share for pre-IPO periods even if such information,
 historically, was not considered meaningful, in order to be consistent with SFAS
 128. However, in accordance with SAB 98, changes in the Company's capital
 structure at the time of the initial public offering relative to preferred stock
 and preferred stock options conversion to common stock and common stock options
 are not presented retroactively. In addition, the number of common shares issued
 during the Company's initial public offering is not retroactively restated. The
 weighted average common shares outstanding under the basic and diluted methods
 described in the preceding paragraph reflect only common stock or common stock
 options actually outstanding for the periods presented. The 8.1192-for-one

 common stock split by the Company at the time of its initial public offering has
 been retroactively restated for all periods presented.
  
      Two new accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
 No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, and No. 131, Disclosures About Segments
 of an Enterprise and Related Information, will take effect during the first
 quarter of 1998. The Company does not expect that the adoption of such new
 accounting standards will have any significant effects on the Company's reported
 financial information.
  
 COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND YEAR 2000
  
      The Company has reviewed its current hardware and software systems,
 including existing interfaces with vendors and customers, and has determined
 that arrival of the year 2000 will not require any significant changes or
 modifications to the Company's existing systems.

       4. Inability to obtain new customers or retain existing ones.

      11. Changes in accounting principles and/or the application of such
          principles to the Company.

 cause the Company's actual results during 1998 and beyond to be materially
 different from any anticipated results expressed in any forward-looking
 statement made by or on behalf of the Company.
  
      The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
 statements to reflect events or other circumstances after date hereof.
