          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
 OVERVIEW
 
     The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of nationally
 branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in
 the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products industry. The
 Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, file
 folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products. Through its
 Ampad division, the Company is among the largest and most important suppliers
 of pads and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies, machine papers
 and retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing office products
 distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is the leading
 supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business envelopes to paper
 merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its future operating
 results will not be directly comparable to its historical operating results
 because of its strategic acquisitions and the expected cost savings from
 integration of its acquisitions. The Company's business has not generally been
 seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may affect
 prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.
 
     Strategic Acquisition.  On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired
 Shade/Allied, a national supplier of machine papers, principally continuous
 computer forms.  The purchase price of $50.7 million was financed with
 borrowings under the Company's bank credit agreement. Shade/Allied's products
 are distributed by both the Ampad and Williamhouse divisions and the
 manufacturing plants are integrated into the Ampad division.  This acquisition
 provided the Company with a more significant position in a fourth product
 category.
 
     Purchase Accounting Effects.   The Company's acquisitions have been
 accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have
 currently affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of
 operations in certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs
 (including assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based
 on the fair market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase
 price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such
 as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill,
 which results in incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each
 year.
 
     Paper Prices.  Paper represents a majority of the Company's cost of goods
 sold.  While paper prices have increased by an average of less than 1% annually
 since 1989, certain commodity grades have shown considerable price volatility
 during that period.  Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted new pricing
 policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the Company's cost
 of paper at the time of shipment.  The Company believes that it is able to
 price its products so as to minimize the impact of price volatility on dollar
 margins.  Paper price volatility has and is expected to continue to have an
 effect on net sales and cost of sales.
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
 operations as a percentage of net sales for the three and six months ended June
 30, 1997 and 1996.  The Company's historical results of operations for each of
 these periods are significantly affected by the results for the following
 business acquired by the Company: (i) Niagara which was acquired on June 28,
 1996 and (ii) Shade/Allied which was acquired on February 11, 1997.

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                                   (CONTINUED)
 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1996
 
     Net Sales for the three months ended June 30, 1997 increased by $53.1
 million, or 46.5%, to $167.2 million from $114.1 million for the three months
 ended June 30, 1996.  Of this net sales increase, $26.2 million is related to
 the acquisition of Niagara and $17.3 million is related to the acquisition of
 Shade/Allied.  Net sales from existing operations increased by approximately
 $9.6 million primarily as the result of strong sales in the superstores and
 contract stationers customer channels.
 
     Gross Profit for the three months ended June 30, 1997 increased by $7.9
 million, or 31.6%, to $32.8 million from $24.9 million for the three months
 ended June 30, 1996.  Approximately $4.0 million of the increase in gross
 profit is attributable to the acquisition of Niagara and $2.3 million is
 attributable to the Shade/Allied acquisition.  The remaining increase in gross
 profit of approximately $1.6 million is attributable to the increased sales
 from existing operations.  Gross profit margin decreased to 19.6% for the three
 months ended June 30, 1997 from 21.9% for the three months ended June 30, 1996.
 The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to increases in
 sales of relatively lower margin products, including those of Shade/Allied, in
 the second quarter of 1997.
 
     SG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 1997 increased $1.7
 million, or 15.2%, to $12.9 million from $11.2 million for the three months 
 ended June 30, 1996.  The acquisitions of Niagara and Shade/Allied resulted in
 additional expense for the three months ended June 30, 1997 of approximately
 $2.0 million which was partially offset by increased efficiencies.  Management
 fees and services expense for the second quarter of 1997 increased by
 approximately $1.3 million as compared to the same quarter of 1996 due
 primarily to a one year non-recurring consulting agreement with the former
 president of Niagara.
 
     Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 1997 decreased $2.9
 million to $9.6 million from $12.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
 1996.  The decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in long-term
 debt which resulted from the Company's initial public offering of common stock
 in the third quarter of 1996.  This decrease in indebtedness was partially
 offset by increased borrowings required for the Shade/Allied acquisition and
 for the increase in working capital.
 
     The income tax provision for the three month period ended June 30, 1997
 reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate of 43.1%
 for the three month period ended June 30, 1996.  The increase is attributable
 primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the Niagara
 and Shade/Allied acquisitions.
 
 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1996
 
     Net Sales for the six months ended June 30, 1997 increased by $82.8
 million, or 35.3%, to $317.0 million from $234.2 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 1996.  Of this net sales increase, $52.7 million is related to
 the acquisition of Niagara and $28.3 million is related to the acquisition of
 Shade/Allied. The remaining increase of approximately $1.8 million is
 attributable to existing operations.
 
     Gross Profit for the six months ended June 30, 1997 increased by $15.3
 million, or 31.6%, to $63.8 million from $48.5 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 1996.  Approximately $7.5 million of the increase in gross profit is
 attributable to the acquisition of Niagara and $3.4 million is attributable to
 the Shade/Allied acquisition.  The remaining increase in gross profit of
 approximately $4.5 million is primarily attributable to increased sales of
 higher margin proprietary products from existing operations, particularly in
 the first quarter of 1997.  Gross profit margin decreased to 20.1% for the six
 months ended June 30, 1997 from 20.7% for the six months ended June 30, 1996.
 The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the addition
 of sales of the relatively lower margin Shade/Allied products during the first
 half of 1997.

     SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 1997 increased $4.9
 million, or 22.6%, to $26.6 million from $21.7 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 1996.  The acquisitions of Niagara and Shade/Allied resulted in
 additional expense for the six months ended June 30, 1997 of approximately $4.3
 million. Management fees and services expense for the first half of 1997
 increased by approximately $2.6 million as compared to the first half of 1996
 due primarily to a one year non-recurring consulting agreement with the former
 president of Niagara.
 
     Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 1997 decreased $7.2
 million to $17.8 million from $25.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
 1996.  The decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in long-term
 debt which resulted from the Company's initial public offering of common stock
 in the third quarter of 1996.  This decrease in indebtedness was partially
 offset by increased borrowings required for the Shade/Allied acquisition and
 for the increase in working capital.
 
     The income tax provision for the six month period ended June 30, 1997
 reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate of 43.2%
 for the six month period ended June 30, 1996.  The increase is attributable
 primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the Niagara
 and Shade/Allied acquisitions.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Net cash used by operating activities for the six months ended June 30,
 1997 of $32.5 million was primarily the net result of the following:  (i) a
 reduction of accounts receivable of $11.4 million as seasonal accounts
 receivable were collected during the first part of the year, (ii) an increase
 in inventories of $33.4 million due to a buildup in anticipation of seasonal,
 promotional and new product sales in the second half of the year and (iii) a
 reduction in accrued expenses of $25.6 million as annual customer volume
 rebates and incentive compensation were paid during the first half of 1997.
 
     Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 1997 of
 $60.1 million was due to the acquisition of Shade/Allied and purchases of
 equipment.
 
     Net cash provided by financing activities during the first half of 1997 was
 $92.0 million and primarily resulted from repayment of $18.0 million in
 financing outstanding under the accounts receivable credit facility and
 borrowings of $110.5 million under the bank credit agreement to finance:  (i)
 such repayment, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii) the purchases of
 equipment and (iv) growth in working capital.
 
     Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
 anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
 available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement
 and the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at June 30,
 1997 of $1.6 million, will be adequate for the foreseeable future to make
 required payments of principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to
 fund anticipated capital expenditures, including anticipated capital
 expenditures of approximately $8 million during the remainder of 1997, and
 working capital requirements, and to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to
 comply with the terms of their debt agreements.  However, actual capital
 requirements may change, particularly as a result of any acquisitions which the
 Company may make.  The ability of the Company to meet its debt service
 obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent, however, upon the
 future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be
 subject to general economic conditions and to financial, business and other
 factors, including factors beyond the Company's control.  A portion of the
 consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at floating rates; therefore,
 its financial condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in
 prevailing interest rates.  The Company has entered into an interest rate
 protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.

 INFLATION
 
     The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
 results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 1997 and
 1996.
 
 NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD
 
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which is effective
 December 15, 1997 and which prescribes a new presentation of earnings per share
 amounts as either "basic" or "diluted."  Basic earnings per share is to be
 calculated as net income divided by the number of outstanding shares of common
 stock.  Diluted earnings per share is to be calculated in a manner similar to
 the "primary" earnings per share currently presented by the Company.  Diluted
 earnings per share is calculated as net income divided the number of
 outstanding shares of common stock, as adjusted for common stock options.  The
 Company intends to implement the new accounting at the end of 1997 and, as part
 of its 1997 annual report to shareholders and Form 10-K, will restate its
 quarterly earnings per share following the guidelines in the new accounting
 standard.  If the new standard had been implemented during the second quarter
 of 1997, earnings per share would have been presented as follows:
