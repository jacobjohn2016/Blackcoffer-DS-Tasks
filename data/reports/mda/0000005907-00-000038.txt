 
                   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
 OVERVIEW
 
 On April 27, 2000,  AT&T completed an initial public  offering of 15.6%,  or 360
 million  shares,  of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an initial public
 offering  price of  $29.50  per  share.  This  stock is  designed  to track  the
 performance  of AT&T's  wireless  services  businesses.  The AT&T Wireless Group
 tracking stock issued in the initial public offering reflected only a portion of
 the economic  interest of the AT&T Wireless  Group.  AT&T retained the remaining
 interest in the economic  performance  of the AT&T Wireless Group in the form of
 an inter-group  interest  which  represented an 84.4% interest as of the date of
 the initial  public  offering and at September  30, 2000.  The results  included
 herein  represent  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  in its  entirety  for all  periods
 presented.  For the portion of the AT&T Wireless  Group's results  attributed to
 the public shareholders, see AT&T's Form 10-Q.
 
 On October 25, 2000,  AT&T  announced  its intention to dispose of its remaining
 interest in the AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock,  which has been approved by
 AT&T's Board of  Directors.  AT&T intends to offer AT&T common  shareowners  the
 opportunity  to exchange  AT&T common  stock for AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking
 stock.  AT&T plans to  distribute  its  remaining  interest in the AT&T Wireless
 group tracking stock to AT&T common  shareowners in 2001. Upon completion of the
 exchange offer and distribution, AT&T intends to convert the AT&T Wireless Group
 tracking stock into an asset-based  AT&T Wireless common stock and distribute to
 its shareowners.
 
 The AT&T Wireless  Group is a fully  integrated  business unit of AT&T. The AT&T
 Wireless  Group  includes  the  results  of  its  mobility  and  fixed  wireless
 businesses, as well as its international operations, which primarily include the
 earnings or losses  associated with equity interests in  international  wireless
 communications ventures and partnerships.
 
 On September 29, 2000,  the AT&T Wireless group  completed the  acquisition of a
 wireless  system  in San  Diego,  which  covers a  population  base of 3 million
 potential  customers.  Also,  during the third quarter,  the AT&T Wireless Group
 completed  its  acquisition  of a  wireless  system on the Big Island of Hawaii.
 Combined,  these two markets  served more than 180  thousand  subscribers  as of
 September 30, 2000. In June 2000, the AT&T Wireless Group closed the acquisition
 of the  remaining  50%  partnership  interest it  previously  did not own in CMT
 Partners (Bay Area Properties).  The Bay Area Properties cover a population base
 exceeding 7 million potential  customers and, as of the acquisition date, served
 nearly 1 million  subscribers.  The  acquisition of the wireless  systems in San
 Diego and the Bay Area was  announced  in  conjunction  with the  signing  of an
 agreement to purchase a wireless  system in Houston,  which is expected to close
 during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2000.  Also in June,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group
 completed its acquisition of Wireless One Network, L.P. (Wireless One). Wireless
 One owns and  operates  wireless  systems in  northwest  and  southwest  Florida
 covering  a  population  base  of  1.6  million  potential   customers  and  had
 approximately  190 thousand  subscribers as of the acquisition date. In February
 2000,  AT&T and  Dobson  Communications  Corporation,  through a joint  venture,
 acquired  American  Cellular  Corporation.  AT&T contributed its interest in the
 joint venture to the AT&T Wireless Group as of the date of the acquisition. This
 acquisition  increased the AT&T Wireless  Group's coverage in New York State and
 several mid-west markets by adding  approximately 450 thousand subscribers as of
 the acquisition date.

 COMBINED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER  30, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE THREE
 AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999
 
 Revenue
 
 Total revenue  includes  wireless voice and data services,  the sale of handsets
 and accessories,  and revenue  associated with the aviation  communications  and
 fixed wireless  operations.  The AT&T Wireless Group records revenue as services
 are provided or when the product is sold.  Services revenue  primarily  includes
 monthly recurring charges,  airtime and toll usage charges,  and roaming charges
 billed to  subscribers  for usage outside of the AT&T Wireless  Group network as
 well as  charges  billed to other  wireless  providers  for  roaming on the AT&T
 Wireless Group network.
 
 Total revenue  increased 36.6% to $2,799 million,  and increased 36.2% to $7,474
 million for the three and nine months ended  September  30, 2000,  respectively,
 compared  with the  respective  prior year periods.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group's
 results include the revenue  associated with the Bay Area Properties  since June
 29, 2000, and Vanguard  Cellular  Systems,  Inc.  (Vanguard  Cellular) since its
 acquisition on May 3, 1999.  Total revenue  increased  29.7% for the nine months
 ended  September 30, 2000,  compared with the same period for 1999,  adjusted to
 exclude the Bay Area  Properties for the three months ended  September 30, 2000,
 and to exclude  Vanguard  Cellular for the period January 2000 to April 2000, to
 correlate results with 1999, due to the May 1999 acquisition.
 
 The revenue  increases  for both the three and nine months ended  September  30,
 2000, were primarily due to growth in our mobility business  revenue,  driven by
 strong  consolidated  subscriber  growth.  Additionally,  an increase in average
 monthly  revenue per user (ARPU) for the nine months ended  September  30, 2000,
 compared with the respective prior year period,  contributed to the year-to-date
 revenue  growth.  AT&T Digital One Rate service,  including  additional  calling
 plans  introduced  in  August  2000 as well as the  AT&T  Regional  and  Digital
 advantage  plans  announced  during the second  quarter  of 2000,  continues  to
 contribute to growth in subscribers as well as an increase in ARPU.
 
 Services  revenue for the three months  ended  September  30,  2000,  was $2,509
 million,  an increase of $642 million,  or 34.3%,  compared with the  respective
 period in 1999.  Services  revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2000,
 was $6,741 million, an increase of $1,813 million,  or 36.8%,  compared with the
 respective period in 1999.
 <PAGE>
 As of  September  30,  2000,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  had over  12.6  million
 consolidated subscribers, an increase of 38.4%, compared with the prior year, of
 which 87.5% were digital  subscribers,  up from 73.5% as of September  30, 1999.
 Included  in  these  figures  were  over  180  thousand   subscribers  from  our
 acquisitions  of the San Diego and  Hawaii  wireless  systems  during  the third
 quarter of 2000,  nearly 1 million  subscribers  from our acquisition of the Bay
 Area  Properties  in June 2000 (which were  previously  reported as  partnership
 subscribers) and approximately 190 thousand  subscribers from our acquisition of
 Wireless One in June 2000. Net consolidated wireless subscriber additions in the
 third  quarter  totaled  750  thousand,  a 195.1%  increase  over the prior year
 quarter.  AT&T Wireless  Group's average monthly churn rate in the third quarter
 of 2000 was 2.9%  compared  with 2.6% in the  third  quarter  of 1999.  The AT&T
 Wireless  Group's  average monthly churn for the nine months ended September 30,
 2000,  was 2.8%  compared  with 2.6% in the  respective  period  in 1999.  Total
 subscribers, including partnership markets in which the AT&T Wireless Group does
 not own a controlling  interest,  were nearly 15 million at the end of the third
 quarter of 2000,  a 26.2%  increase  over the prior year  quarter.  Ending total
 subscribers included  approximately 450 thousand subscribers associated with the
 AT&T Wireless Group's acquisition of American Cellular in February 2000.
 
 The AT&T  Wireless  Group's ARPU for the three months ended  September 30, 2000,
 was $68.5, an increase of $0.3, or 0.4%,  compared with the same period in 1999,
 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2000, ARPU was $69.1, an increase of
 $3.7, or 5.7%, compared with the same period in 1999. The increase was primarily
 due to increased minutes of use per subscriber,  driven in part by the continued
 success  of AT&T  Digital  One Rate  service.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ARPU
 remained  significantly  higher than the wireless  industry  average  during the
 three and nine months ended  September  30, 2000,  excluding  the AT&T  Wireless
 Group.
 
 Equipment  revenue for the three  months  ended  September  30,  2000,  was $290
 million, an increase of $108 million, or 59.9%, compared with the same period in
 1999.  Equipment  revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2000, was $733
 million, an increase of $171 million, or 30.6%, compared with the same period in
 1999.  These  increases were primarily due to 85.5% and 47.4% increases in gross
 consolidated  subscriber  additions in the three and nine months ended September
 30, 2000,  respectively,  compared with the same periods in 1999. As an integral
 part of the wireless service  offering,  the AT&T Wireless Group supplies to its
 subscribers a selection of handsets at competitive  prices,  which are generally
 offered at or below cost.
 
 Costs of services and products
 
 Costs of services and products include the costs to place calls over the network
 (including the costs to operate and maintain the AT&T Wireless  Group's  network
 as well as  roaming  costs  paid to  other  wireless  providers),  the  costs of
 handsets and accessories provided to the AT&T Wireless Group's customers and the
 charges paid to connect calls on other networks, including those of AT&T.
 
 Costs of services and products for the three and nine months ended September 30,
 2000, were $1,381 million and $3,639 million, respectively. This was an increase
 of $388 million,  or 39.2%,  for the three months ended  September 30, 2000, and
 $896 million,  or 32.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2000,  compared
 with the same periods in 1999.  These  increases were due primarily to increases
 in the handsets  provided to subscribers which were attributable to the increase
 in gross subscriber additions.  Additionally,  growth in the subscriber base and
 increased  minutes of use per  subscriber  resulted in an increase in the access
 and other connection charges paid to connect calls on other networks,  including
 AT&T, as well as the costs to maintain the AT&T Wireless Group's network.
 <PAGE>
 Roaming  expenses  decreased  12.5% and 3.0% for the three and nine months ended
 September  30,  2000,  respectively,  compared  with the same  periods for 1999,
 despite continued growth in off-network roaming minutes. The decrease in roaming
 expenses was driven primarily by a significant  decrease in the roaming rate per
 minute of usage,  as well as  initiatives to  aggressively  migrate more minutes
 onto the AT&T Wireless Group's network.
 
 Selling, general and administrative
 
 Selling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  for the three and nine
 months  ended  September  30,  2000,  were  $946  million  and  $2,459  million,
 respectively,  compared  with $655 million and $1,833  million for the three and
 nine months ended September 30, 1999. These increases were largely  attributable
 to higher  marketing and selling costs,  primarily  advertising and commissions,
 associated with the increase in gross consolidated  subscriber additions for the
 three and nine months  ended  September  30,  2000,  compared to the  respective
 periods in 1999. Cost per gross subscriber  addition (CPGA),  which includes the
 cost of handset  subsidies  recorded  in costs of services  and  products in the
 accompanying  combined statement of operations,  was $359 and $357 for the three
 and nine months ended  September  30, 2000,  compared with $369 and $353 for the
 three and nine months  ended  September  30, 1999.  In  addition,  growth in the
 wireless  customer base resulted in an increase in  information  technology  and
 customer care related expenses.
 
 Depreciation and amortization
 
 Depreciation and amortization  expenses for the three months ended September 30,
 2000, were $445 million,  an increase of $112 million,  or 33.4%,  compared with
 the third quarter of 1999.  Depreciation and amortization  expenses for the nine
 months  ended  September  30,  2000,  were $1,216  million,  an increase of $299
 million, or 32.5%,  compared with the first nine months of 1999. These increases
 primarily  resulted  from the growth in the AT&T  Wireless  Group's  depreciable
 asset base resulting from capital  expenditures  to increase the capacity of the
 network and improve call quality.  Additionally,  amortization expense increased
 for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2000,  as a  result  of the  1999
 acquisitions of Vanguard Cellular and Honolulu Cellular, and the acquisitions of
 the Bay Area  Properties  and Wireless One in 2000.  Total capital  expenditures
 were $920  million  and  $3,043  million  for the three  and nine  months  ended
 September 30, 2000, respectively.
 
 Other income (expense)
 
 Other income (expense)  primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges
 of assets, net equity earnings from investments, intercompany interest income on
 the  note  receivable   from  AT&T,  and  minority   interests  in  consolidated
 subsidiaries.  Other  income  (expense)  for the  three  and nine  months  ended
 September 30, 2000, was $78 million and $386 million, respectively. Other income
 (expense) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1999, was expense of
 $4 million and income of $180 million,  respectively. The increase for the three
 months  ended  September  30, 2000 was due  primarily to  intercompany  interest
 income on the note  receivable from AT&T. The increase for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2000,  was due primarily to  intercompany  interest  income on the
 note receivable from AT&T, as well as higher gains on the sales of assets.
 
 Interest expense
 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest on intercompany debt due to AT&T
 less interest  expense  capitalized.  Interest  expense for the third quarter of
 2000,  was $4 million,  a decrease of $28 million,  or 88.5%,  compared with the
 third  quarter of 1999.  Interest  expense for the first nine months of 2000 was
 <PAGE>
 $73 million, a decrease of $29 million,  or 28.4%,  compared with the first nine
 months of 1999.  The decrease for the third  quarter of 2000,  compared with the
 third  quarter of 1999,  was due to higher levels of  capitalized  interest as a
 result of  increased  capital  expenditures,  as well as lower levels of average
 outstanding  debt due to AT&T. The decrease in the average  outstanding debt due
 to AT&T was  attributable to the  recapitalization  of $2.0 billion of long term
 debt due to AT&T into 9% cumulative  preferred  stock  subsequent to the initial
 public offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.  These decreases were
 partially offset by a higher rate of interest  charged on the intercompany  debt
 in the third quarter of 2000 versus the prior year quarter.  For the nine months
 ended September 30, 2000, the decrease in interest  expense was due to decreased
 levels of outstanding debt, as well as increased capitalized interest, partially
 offset by a higher interest rate.
 
 Provision for income taxes
 
 The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30,
 2000, was $80 million and $226 million, respectively,  compared with $14 million
 and $31 million for the same periods in 1999,  respectively.  The  increases for
 both the three and nine month periods were due to higher income before taxes and
 higher  effective tax rates.  The  effective  income tax rates for the three and
 nine month periods ended September 30, 2000 were 78.9% and 47.8%,  respectively,
 compared with 49.3% and 41.2%, for the same periods in 1999,  respectively.  The
 effective  income tax rate for the three months ended  September  30, 2000,  was
 impacted by the increase in the estimated  annual effective tax rate. The annual
 estimated  effective  income tax rate of 47.8% increased from the estimated rate
 of 39.3% as of June 30, 2000. The annual estimated effective income tax rate was
 impacted by  acquisitions  closed  during the quarter as well as foreign  equity
 investments.  The  effective  income  tax  rate  for  each of the  1999  periods
 presented was impacted by the benefit from a change in the  valuation  allowance
 and other estimates, offset by unutilized foreign equity losses and amortization
 of intangibles.
 
 Dividend requirements on preferred stock held by AT&T
 
 At September  30, 2000,  and December  31,  1999,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group had
 outstanding,  $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion,  respectively,  of preferred  stock
 held by AT&T that pays dividends at 9% per annum.  Intercompany  indebtedness of
 $2.0 billion was recapitalized  into an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative
 preferred stock following the initial public offering.  Dividend requirements on
 this  preferred  stock for the three and nine months ended  September  30, 2000,
 were  $42  million  and $88  million,  respectively,  and for the  corresponding
 periods in 1999 were $14 million and $41 million,  respectively,  net of amounts
 recorded in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 The continued expansion of the AT&T Wireless Group's network, footprint and
 service offerings, and the marketing and distribution of its products and
 services, will continue to require substantial capital.  The AT&T Wireless Group
 has funded its operations by initial public  offering  proceeds  attributed from
 AT&T,  intercompany borrowings from AT&T and internally generated funds, as well
 as capital contributions from AT&T prior to the initial public offering. Capital
 contributions   from  AT&T  prior  to  the  initial  public  offering   included
 acquisitions  made by AT&T that have been attributed to the AT&T Wireless Group.
 Noncash  capital  contributions  from AT&T to the AT&T Wireless Group related to
 acquisitions  and initial  investments  funded by AT&T  totaled $539 million and
 $2,332  million  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2000  and  1999,
 respectively.
 <PAGE>
 The initial  public  offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted
 in net proceeds to AT&T after deducting  underwriter's discount and related fees
 and expenses of $10.3 billion.  AT&T attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds
 to the AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany  note receivable.  Net
 transfers to and from the AT&T Wireless Group and AT&T subsequent to the initial
 public offering are reflected as changes in the  intercompany  note  receivable.
 After the attributed $7.0 billion of initial public offering  proceeds are fully
 utilized,  AT&T may issue  short term  floating  rate debt to the AT&T  Wireless
 Group.  In addition,  AT&T is  considering  a debt offering by the AT&T Wireless
 Group.
 
 On May 1, 2000,  following the initial public offering,  the AT&T Wireless Group
 recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to AT&T into
 an  additional  $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred  stock held by AT&T. In
 conjunction with the recapitalization,  the AT&T Wireless Group's long term debt
 due to AT&T was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a
 fixed rate of 8.1% per annum.
 
 Financing  activities  for the AT&T  Wireless  Group  are  managed  by AT&T on a
 centralized  basis and are  subject  to the  review of the AT&T  Wireless  Group
 capital stock committee.  Sources for the AT&T Wireless Group's future financing
 requirements may include the issuance of additional AT&T Wireless Group tracking
 stock and the borrowing of funds,  including  short term floating rate debt from
 AT&T and/or third-party debt. Loans from AT&T to any member of the AT&T Wireless
 Group will be made at interest rates and on other terms and conditions  designed
 to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rates  and  other  terms and
 conditions  that the AT&T  Wireless  Group  would be able to obtain  from  third
 parties,  including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate  of AT&T without the
 benefit of any guaranty by AT&T. This policy  contemplates that these loans will
 be made on the basis set forth above  regardless of the interest rates and other
 terms and  conditions  on which AT&T may have acquired the funds.  If,  however,
 AT&T incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available  funds for use by the
 AT&T  Wireless  Group,  those  fees or  charges  will be  allocated  to the AT&T
 Wireless Group.
 
 Net cash provided by operating  activities  for the nine months ended  September
 30, 2000,  was $861  million,  compared with $527 million for the same period in
 1999. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to
 an  increase  in  operating  income  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization,
 resulting  from revenue growth and expense  leveraging,  an increase in deferred
 income  taxes,   and  an  increase  in  other   operating  and  payroll  related
 liabilities,   partially   offset  by  increases  in  inventories  and  accounts
 receivable.  Net cash used in  investing  activities  for the nine months  ended
 September 30, 2000,  was $8,993  million,  compared with $1,158  million for the
 nine months  ended  September  30, 1999.  The increase was due  primarily to the
 issuance  of  a  note  receivable  from  AT&T,  acquisitions  of  the  Bay  Area
 Properties,  Wireless  One,  and the San  Diego  property,  and  higher  capital
 expenditures  to upgrade and increase  network  capacity in existing  markets as
 well as to  expand  the  national  footprint.  Net cash  provided  by  financing
 activities  for the nine months ended  September 30, 2000,  was $8,132  million,
 compared with $620 million for the nine months  September 30, 1999. The increase
 was primarily due to proceeds attributed from the initial public offering of the
 AT&T Wireless Group  tracking  stock and increased  transfers from AT&T prior to
 the  initial   public   offering  to  fund   acquisitions   and  higher  capital
 expenditures.
 
 EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  is the  primary  measure  used by the  chief
 operating  decision-makers to measure our ability to generate cash flow. EBITDA,
 excluding  other  income,  defined as  operating  income plus  depreciation  and
 <PAGE>
 amortization,  may or may not be consistent  with the  calculation of EBITDA for
 other public  companies and should not be viewed by investors as an  alternative
 to generally accepted accounting principles,  measures of performance or to cash
 flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
 liquidity.
 
 EBITDA,  excluding  other income,  for the three and nine months ended September
 30, 2000, was $472 million and $1,376 million, respectively,  compared with $401
 million  and $914  million  for the same  periods in 1999.  The  increases  were
 primarily the result of revenue growth and lower  off-network  roaming expenses.
 These improvements were partially offset by increased customer acquisition costs
 associated with the increase in gross subscriber  additions,  increased  network
 costs  attributable  to the growth in subscribers  and their minutes of use, and
 increased information technology costs to support growth in the subscriber base.
 
 For our mobility  business,  EBITDA,  excluding other income,  for the three and
 nine months  ended  September  30, 2000,  was $522  million and $1,503  million,
 respectively,  compared  with $421 million and $973 million for the same periods
 in 1999.
 
 For our fixed wireless business,  EBITDA,  excluding other income, for the three
 and nine months ended  September 30, 2000, were deficits of $49 million and $123
 million, respectively, compared with deficits of $17 million and $49 million for
 the same periods in 1999.
 
 EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  margins  were  16.8% and 18.4% for the third
 quarter and first nine  months of 2000,  respectively,  compared  with 19.6% and
 16.6% for the third  quarter  and first nine months of 1999,  respectively.  The
 decline in EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  margins for the third  quarter of
 2000,  compared to the third  quarter of 1999,  was  primarily  due to increased
 customer acquisition costs associated with the 85.5% quarter over quarter growth
 in  gross  consolidated  subscriber  additions,  as  well as  increased  cost of
 handsets sold,  partially offset by declining roaming expenses.  The improvement
 in EBITDA,  excluding  other income,  margins for the first nine months of 2000,
 compared  to the first  nine  months of 1999,  was driven  primarily  by revenue
 growth and expense leveraging, primarily off-network roaming expenses, partially
 offset by increased customer acquisition and customer care costs associated with
 growth in the subscriber base.
 
 EBITDA, excluding other income, margins for our mobility business were 18.7% and
 20.1%  for the  third  quarter  and first  nine  months  of 2000,  respectively,
 compared  with 20.5% and 17.7% for the third  quarter  and first nine  months of
 1999, respectively.
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
 Total assets were  $33,045  million as of  September  30,  2000,  an increase of
 $9,533 million, or 40.5%,  compared with December 31, 1999. The increase was due
 primarily  to  increases  in  goodwill,  licensing  costs,  property,  plant and
 equipment,  and other assets  associated  with the  acquisitions of the Bay Area
 Properties,  Wireless  One,  and the San  Diego  property,  the  initial  public
 offering proceeds attributed to the AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T in the form of
 an intercompany note receivable,  and increased property, plant and equipment as
 a result of  significant  capital  spending  in the first  nine  months of 2000.
 Additionally,   non-consolidated  investments  increased  as  a  result  of  the
 investment in American Cellular during 2000, partially offset by the acquisition
 of the remaining 50% interest in CMT Partners, which is now consolidated.
 <PAGE>
 Total  liabilities  were $8,542  million as of September 30, 2000, a decrease of
 $953  million,  or 10.0%,  compared  with  December 31,  1999.  The decrease was
 primarily due to the decrease in long term debt due to AT&T  resulting  from the
 recapitalization  of the AT&T Wireless  Group  subsequent to the initial  public
 offering,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  deferred  income  taxes,  other
 long-term  liabilities,  and other current  liabilities.  Deferred incomes taxes
 increased due to the deferred tax provision recognized for the nine months ended
 September  30,  2000.  Other  long-term  liabilities  increased  due to proceeds
 received in consideration for a long-term leasing arrangement, and other current
 liabilities increased due to increased business taxes and operating accruals.
 
 Total  preferred  stock held by AT&T  increased to $3.0 billion at September 30,
 2000,  from $1.0 billion at December 31, 1999,  due to the  recapitalization  of
 $2.0 billion of intercompany debt into preferred stock subsequent to the initial
 public  offering.  Dividends  payable on the preferred stock were paid at 9% per
 annum.
 
 Total  equity was  $24,502  million as of  September  30,  2000,  an increase of
 $10,505  million,  or 75.1%,  compared with December 31, 1999.  The increase was
 primarily due to increased  combined  equity  associated with the attribution of
 initial  public  offering  proceeds to the AT&T Wireless  Group,  as well as net
 transfers  from  AT&T  prior to the  initial  public  offering  to fund  capital
 expansion and  acquisitions,  and the additional $2.0 billion of preferred stock
 issued to AT&T.
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
 In December  1999, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) issued Staff
 Accounting   Bulletin   (SAB)  No.  101,   "Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
 Statements".  SAB No. 101 provides  guidance on revenue  recognition,  including
 service  activation fees, and certain related costs,  which requires adoption by
 the end of fiscal year 2000.  Management does not expect the adoption of SAB No.
 101 to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results  of
 operations, financial position or cash flows.
 
 In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
 of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative
 Instruments and Hedging  Activities".  Among other provisions,  it requires that
 entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
 statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
 Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
 would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
 qualifies for hedge accounting.  The effective date of this standard was delayed
 via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The effective date for SFAS No. 133 is now for
 fiscal  years  beginning  after  June  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
 encouraged and  retroactive  application  is  prohibited.  For the AT&T Wireless
 Group,  this means that the  standard  must be adopted no later than  January 1,
 2001.  Based on the types of contracts we currently  have,  management  does not
 expect the  adoption of this  standard  will have a material  impact on the AT&T
 Wireless Group's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
 
 In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting for Certain  Derivative
 Instruments  and Certain  Hedging  Activities"  as an amendment to SFAS No. 133.
 This  statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
 issues  under SFAS No. 133 on  specific  types of hedges.  Based on the types of
 contracts we currently have, management does not expect this statement to have a
 material impact on the AT&T Wireless  Group's  results of operations,  financial
 position or cash flows.

 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
 On November  13,  2000,  TeleCorp  PCS,  Inc.  (Telecorp)  completed  its merger
 agreement  with Tritel,  Inc., as part of a stock  transaction.  Pursuant to the
 terms of the  agreement,  each  company  merged  with a  separate  newly  formed
 subsidiary of a new holding company named TeleCorp PCS, Inc., upon  consummation
 of the  transaction.  Prior to the merger,  the AT&T Wireless  Group held equity
 interests in each of TeleCorp and Tritel which were both  affiliates of the AT&T
 Wireless  Group.  In  connection  with  the  merger,  the  AT&T  Wireless  Group
 contributed  to  TeleCorp  PCS,  Inc.,  rights to  acquire  additional  wireless
 licenses  in  Wisconsin  and Iowa,  paid  approximately  $20 million in cash and
 extended the term of its brand license  agreement through July 2005, in exchange
 for approximately 9.3 million common shares in the newly combined company.  This
 transaction  will bring the AT&T Wireless  Group's  equity stake in the combined
 company  to  approximately   23%,  assuming  the  conversion  of  all  currently
 convertible  preferred  stock to common stock.  In a separate  transaction  with
 TeleCorp,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  completed an exchange of certain  wireless
 licenses and rights to acquire  licenses in the Wisconsin  and Iowa markets,  as
 well as made a cash payment of approximately  $80 million.  In return,  the AT&T
 Wireless Group received  TeleCorp's PCS licenses and wireless systems in several
 New England  markets.  The AT&T Wireless  Group  anticipates it will recognize a
 significant gain on the transactions.
 
 On October 25, 2000,  AT&T  announced  its intention to dispose of its remaining
 interest in the AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock,  which has been approved by
 AT&T's Board of  Directors.  AT&T intends to offer AT&T common  shareowners  the
 opportunity  to exchange  AT&T common  stock for AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking
 stock.  AT&T plans to  distribute  its  remaining  interest in the AT&T Wireless
 group tracking stock to AT&T common  shareowners in 2001. Upon completion of the
 exchange offer and distribution, AT&T intends to convert the AT&T Wireless Group
 tracking stock into an asset-based  AT&T Wireless common stock and distribute to
 its shareowners.
 
 On October 2, 2000, the AT&T Wireless Group completed its acquisition of several
 equity interests in international  ventures  acquired by AT&T as a result of its
 acquisition  of MediaOne in June 2000.  The AT&T Wireless  Group  acquired these
 interests from AT&T for  approximately  $1 billion in cash, which was determined
 based  upon a third  party  valuation.  Additionally,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group
 assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling  approximately $220 million which were
 transferred from AT&T.
 
 On October 2, 2000,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  completed its  acquisition  of a
 wireless  system in  Indianapolis  for  approximately  $530 million in cash. The
 transaction was recorded under the purchase method of accounting.
