 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      Revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales.  Total rental revenue
 was $679.1 million and $641.8 million for the six months ended September 30,
 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net revenues from the rental of moving related
 equipment increased by $31.1 million.  This increase is primarily attributable
 to higher truck and trailer rental revenues and storage revenues.
 
      Net sales revenues were $114.0 million and $110.1 million for the six
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth resulted
 from an increase in the sale of moving support items and an increase in the sale
 of hitches.
 
      Cost of sales was $66.0 million and $62.7 million for the six months ended
 September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  A higher sales volume contributed to
 the increase.
 
      Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations were $491.8 million and
 $476.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Increased expenditure levels for personnel and rental equipment
 maintenance, due to an increase in truck rental transactions and in fleet size,
 were primarily responsible.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $39.2 million and $33.9 million for the six
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase reflects
 depreciation on the rental truck fleet.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $121.6 million
 and $117.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.

 Real Estate Operations
      Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $36.1 million and $36.5
 million for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Intercompany revenue was $34.8 million and $35.3 million for the six months
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      Net investment and interest income was $5.1 million and $4.7 million for
 the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase
 correlates to an increase in average note and mortgage outstanding.
 
      Net depreciation expense was $5.3 million and $4.6 million for the six
 months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is due
 to the build out of storage facilities.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $8.1 million
 and $13.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  The decrease reflects increases in lease expenses.
 
 Property and Casualty
      RepWest's premiums were $72.3 million and $64.6 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  General agency premiums were $20.3
 million and $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  Assumed treaty reinsurance premium was $22.9 million and $20.9
 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Rental
 industry revenue was $17.0 million and $23.9 million for the six months ending
 June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This change was caused by the
 restructuring of the rental industry Business Auto General Liability Policy.
 
      Net investment income was $15.8 million and $16.7 million for the six
 months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The reduction is
 attributable to decreased gains and decreased invested assets.
 
      Benefits and losses were $60.1 million and $53.7 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase is due to new agency
 programs in Non-Standard Auto and Transportation, which were offset by a
 decrease in rental industry incurred.
 
      The amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) were $6.4 million and
 $6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 decrease was related to the timing of inception of new business.
 
      Operating expenses were $19.7 million and $15.7 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The difference was due to
 increased personnel, changes in claims handling procedures and commissions on
 new agency business premium writings.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $1.9 million
 and $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease is the result of additional incurred losses and operating expense,
 and decreased investment income, offset by an increase in earned premiums.

 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $51.5 million and $47.2 million for the six months ended
 June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The difference was primarily due to a
 $2.2 million increase in the credit insurance lines and a $2.6 million increase
 in the Medicare supplement line.
 
      Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $12.4 million
 and $10.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The increase was due to improved interest rate spreads on the interest sensitive
 products and a larger invested asset base.
 
      Benefits were $35.7 million and $30.3 million for the six months ended June
 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Medicare supplement benefits increased $3.7
 million from 1999; credit insurance benefits increased $2.1 million from 1999.
 These increases are primarily due to higher loss ratios.  Other health insurance
 benefits increased $0.8 million for the year primarily from one-time charges.
 The life insurance lines have had better mortality experience in 2000, resulting
 in a $1.2 million decrease in benefits from 1999.
 
      Amortization of DAC was $10.2 million and $8.1 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase resulted from a $1.0
 million increase in the annuity lines and $1.1 million increase in the credit
 insurance lines.
 
      Operating expenses were $13.2 million and $12.5 million for the six months
 ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is due to premium
 volume increases.
 
      Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was $4.7 million
 and $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 The decrease is due to loss ratios on the Medicare supplement business and
 Credit insurance business.
 
 Interest Expense
      Interest expense was $44.1 million and $39.8 million for the six months
 ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase can be attributed
 to increases in the average debt outstanding and in the average cost of debt.
 
 Consolidated Group
      As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $122.1 million and
 $130.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.  After providing for income taxes, net earnings were $78.8 million
 and $84.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.

 $3.4 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 decrease was related to the timing of inception of new business.
 
      Operating expenses were $11.4 million and $7.5 million for the quarters

 Transportation coverages.
 
      Operating profit (loss) before tax and intercompany elimination was ($0.4)
 million and $3.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,

 Life Insurance
      Net premiums were $26.0 million and $22.1 million for the quarters ended
 June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The change is primarily due to a $1.4
 million increase in the credit insurance line and a $1.6 million increase in the
 Medicare supplement line.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Moving and Storage Operations
      To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul maintains a large inventory
 of rental items.  In the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
 capital expenditures were $260.9 million and $182.7 million, respectively.
 These expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck fleet.
 The capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained through internally
 generated funds from operations and through lease financings.
 
      Cash provided by operating activities was $61.0 million and $96.1 million
 for the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 decrease resulted primarily from an increase in receivables and a decrease in
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
 
      At September 30, 2000, total outstanding notes and loans payable was
 $1,096.2 million as compared to $1,137.8 million at March 31, 2000.
 
 Real Estate Operations
      Cash provided by operating activities was $8.3 million and $2.5 million for
 the six months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
 resulted from a decrease in receivables.
 
 Property and Casualty
      Cash used by operating activities was $(1.8) million and $(6.6) million for
 six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This change resulted
 from increases in unearned premuium and reinsurance losses payable from December
 1999 to June 2000.  The increase was offset by a larger decrease in loss and
 loss adjusting expense reserves from December 1999 to June 2000, decreased net
 income and a larger increase in deferred policy acquisition costs.
 
      RepWest's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio
 were $10.4 million and $10.5 million at June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 
      RepWest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily
 in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-income securities
 consisting of investment grade securities.  The maturity distribution is
 designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current
 liquidity remains strong with current invested assets equal to 92.2% of total
 liabilities.
 
      The liability for reported and unreported losses isare based upon company
 historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on
 historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.  Unpaid loss
 and loss expenses are not discounted.

 Life Insurance
      Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest-
 sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of cash are
 operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching the investment
 portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an
 important consideration.
 
      Cash provided (used) by operating activities was ($3.4) million and $2.4
 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
 decrease is due to higher benefit payouts in relation to collected premium.
 Cash provided by financing activities were $2.4 million and $0.3 million for the
 six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is due to a
 better ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals.
 
      In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a
 substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-term
 portfolio. Short-term investments were $51.6 million and $75.6 million for the
 six months ending June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Management believes
 that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash
 needs.
 
 Consolidated Group
      During each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, AMERCO
 estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately $380 million
 primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.  This level of capital expenditures,
 combined with an average of approximately $72 million in annual long-term debt
 maturities during this same period, are expected to create annual average
 funding needs of approximately $452 million.
 
 Credit Agreements
      AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
 arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured medium-term
 notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.
 Principally to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, AMERCO routinely enters
 into sale and leaseback transactions.  As of September 30, 2000, AMERCO had
 $1,096.2 million in total notes and loans payable outstanding and
 unutilized lines of credit of approximately $284.2 million.
 
      Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
 other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
 additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing
 certain additional liens on its properties, assets and restricting the issuance
 of certain types of preferred stock.  At September 30, 2000, AMERCO was in
 compliance with these covenants.
 
      Reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 in AMERCO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000
 for additional information about AMERCO's credit agreements.
