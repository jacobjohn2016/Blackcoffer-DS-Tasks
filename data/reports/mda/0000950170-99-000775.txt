         OF OPERATIONS
 
 1998 ACQUISITIONS
 
          On March 30, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
 acquired approximately 81% of the total number of then outstanding shares of
 common stock of Coleman from an affiliate of M&F, in exchange for 14,099,749
 shares of the Company's common stock and approximately $160 million in cash. In
 addition, the Company assumed approximately $1,016 million in debt. Immediately
 thereafter, as a result of the exercise of employee stock options, Sunbeam's
 indirect beneficial ownership of Coleman decreased to approximately 79% of the
 total number of the outstanding shares of Coleman common stock. The Company's
 agreement for the acquisition of the remaining publicly held Coleman shares
 pursuant to a merger transaction provides that the remaining Coleman
 shareholders will receive approximately 6.7 million shares of Sunbeam common
 stock (0.5677 share for each outstanding Coleman share) and approximately $87
 million in cash ($6.44 for each outstanding Coleman share and a cash-out of
 unexercised Coleman options equal to the difference between $27.50 per share and
 the exercise price of such options. The Company expects to complete the Coleman
 merger during the second half of 1999, although there can be no assurance that
 the merger will occur during that time. See Notes 2 and 15 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 - "Significant 1998 Financial and
 Business Developments - Settlement of Coleman-Related Claims" for information
 regarding the settlement of certain claims relating to the Coleman acquisition,
 the terms of which involved the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of the
 Company's common stock at $7.00 per share.
 
          On April 6, 1998, the Company completed the cash acquisitions of First
 Alert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and
 Signature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.
 The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued at
 approximately $182 million (including $133 million of cash and $49 million of
 assumed debt) and $255 million (reflecting cash paid, including the required
 retirement or defeasance of debt), respectively.
 
          The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting
 and accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of each
 acquired entity are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the
 respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired entities
 have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
 on estimates of fair values (determined by independent appraisals) at the dates
 of acquisition.
 
 FISCAL YEAR
 
          To standardize the fiscal period ends of the Company and the acquired
 entities, effective with its 1998 fiscal year, the Company has changed its
 fiscal year end from the Sunday nearest December 31 to a calendar year. (See
 Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES
 
 GOODWILL
 
          When changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
 goodwill may not be recoverable, the Company estimates future cash flows using
 the recoverability method (undiscounted future cash flows and including related
 interest charges) as a basis for recording any impairment loss. An impairment
 loss is then recorded to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to the
 recoverable amount. The impairment loss taken is no greater than the amount by
 which the carrying value of the net assets of the business exceeds its fair
 value. Due to First Alert's financial performance in 1998 and its prospects in
 1999 and beyond, the Company determined that the goodwill relating to this
 acquisition was impaired. Accordingly, based on its determination of fair value,
 the Company has written off the net carrying value of goodwill of $62.5 million
 in the fourth quarter of 1998.
 
 FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY RESERVES
 
          In the second quarter of 1998, the Company decided to outsource or
 discontinue a substantial number of products previously made by the Company,
 resulting in certain facilities and equipment that will either no longer be used
 or will be utilized in a significantly different manner. Accordingly, a charge
 of $29.6 million was recorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write certain of these
 assets down to their estimated fair market market value. Approximately 80% of
 this charge related to machinery, equipment and tooling at the Company's Mexico
 City and Hattiesburg, Mississippi manufacturing plants, the estimated fair value
 for which was derived through an auction process. The remainder of this charge
 related to tooling and equipment at various other facilities, which either had a
 nominal value or the fair market value of which was derived through
 
                                        20
 <PAGE>
 
 an auction process. These assets were taken out of service at the time of the
 write-down and consequently were not depreciated further after the write-down.
 
          Personnel at the Mexico City facility were notified in the second
 quarter of 1998 that the plant was scheduled for closure at year-end 1998,
 accordingly, at that time a liability of $1.8 million was recorded in Cost of
 Goods Sold primarily for employee severance. The employee severance related to
 approximately 1,200 positions of which approximately 1,100 were terminated as of
 December 31, 1998. In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded in Cost of
 Goods Sold an additional provision for impairment of fixed assets of $3.1
 million in an acquired entity relating to assets taken out of service for which
 there was no remaining value. The asset impairment resulted from management's
 decision to discontinue certain product lines subsequent to the acquisition.
 These fixed assets were taken out of service at the time of the write-down and
 consequently were not depreciated further after the write-down. In the fourth
 quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a $7.1 million charge as a result of
 management's decision to outsource the production of certain appliances. This
 charge to Cost of Goods Sold primarily consists of a provision for certain
 tooling and equipment ($6.7 million) and severance and related benefits ($0.4
 million). The tooling and equipment was written down to its estimated fair value
 which was derived from comparable market data. This equipment was taken out of
 service and depreciation of this equipment was discontinued at the time of the
 write-down.
 
          During 1997 and the first half of 1998, the Company built inventories
 in anticipation of 1998 sales volumes which did not materialize. As a result, it
 has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess
 inventories at amounts less than cost. Accordingly, during 1998, when the facts
 and circumstances were known that such sales volume would not materialize, the
 Company recorded $58.2 million in charges to properly state this inventory at
 the lower-of-cost-or-market. This inventory primarily related to certain
 appliances, grills and grill accessories. The Company also recorded a charge of
 $11.0 million for excess inventories for raw materials and work in process which
 will not be used due to outsourcing the production of irons, breadmakers,
 toasters and certain other appliances. In addition, during 1998, the Company
 made the decision to exit certain product lines, primarily air and water
 filtration products and eliminate certain stock keeping units ("SKU'S") within
 existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill
 accessories. As a result of this decision, a $26.6 million charge was recorded
 to properly state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. Total charges
 for excess inventories recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-market amounted to
 approximately $95.8 million at December 31, 1998. (See Note 12 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements for asset impairment and other charges
 recorded in conjunction with a 1996 restructuring plan.)
 
 RESTATEMENTS
 
          On June 30, 1998, Sunbeam announced that the Audit Committee was
 initiating a review into the accuracy of Sunbeam's prior financial statements.
 The Audit Committee's review has since been completed and, as a result of its
 findings, Sunbeam has restated its previously issued consolidated financial
 statements for 1996 and 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. Based upon the
 review, it was determined that certain revenue had been inappropriately
 recognized, certain costs and allowances had not been accrued or were improperly
 recorded, and certain costs were inappropriately included in, and subsequently
 charged to, restructuring, asset impairment and other costs within the
 Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 29, 1996 and
 December 28, 1997 and the three months ended March 31, 1998. The financial
 statements for the years ended December 28, 1997 and December 29, 1996 were
 audited and filed on Form 10-K/A with the SEC on November 9, 1998. The
 accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the restated results.
 
          In connection with the restatements referred to above, the Company was
 advised by Arthur Andersen that there existed conditions that Arthur Andersen
 believed to be material weaknesses in the Company's internal control. See Item 9
 - - "Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
 Disclosure". In order to address these material weaknesses, the Company has
 increased the number of senior financial personnel and has implemented
 comprehensive review procedures of operating and financial information.
 Additionally, as explained in more detail under "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure"
 within Item 7, the Company is in the process of significantly enhancing its
 operating systems. The Company anticipates that its systems enhancements will be
 completed in 1999.
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997
 
          Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998 include the
 results of Coleman from March 30, 1998 and of Signature Brands and First Alert
 from April 6, 1998, the respective dates of the acquisition. The acquired
 entities generated net sales of $1,009.0 million from the acquisition dates
 noted above through December 31, 1998, with corresponding gross margin of $205.1
 million, or 20% of sales. SG&A costs recorded by the acquired entities were
 $329.9 million in the period, yielding an operating loss of $124.8 million.
 
                                        21
 <PAGE>
 
          For the acquired entities, net sales from the dates of the acquisitions
 through fiscal year-end were approximately $152 million lower than the sales for
 the same period in the prior year. This decline was caused by lower net sales at
 Coleman ($81.5 million), Signature Brands ($31.2 million) and First Alert ($39.2
 million). Excluding the effects of Coleman's sale of its safety and security
 business in March 1998 and the discontinuation of its pressure washer business
 during 1997, Coleman's 1998 sales would have been approximately $4 million lower
 than in 1997. The Company believes that Signature Brands' decline, primarily in
 its coffee and tea products, resulted largely from lost distribution and
 insufficient attention to the business during part of 1998. The Company believes
 that all of the acquired businesses were, to some extent, impacted by the
 disruption that arose from the integration with Sunbeam and the related
 management changes, both at the acquired companies and at Sunbeam. First Alert's
 sales decline related predominately to increased inventory positions in the
 domestic channel in 1997 as compared to 1998 with the remaining decrease
 primarily related to more favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of
 1997 as compared to the same period in 1998 which affected consumer shopping
 patterns. Excluding the effects from purchase accounting and the write-off of
 First Alert's goodwill, as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements, operating profit for these three companies declined by
 approximately $45 million since the dates of the acquisitions in 1998 as
 compared to the same period in the prior year, resulting primarily from lower
 net sales. Although there can be no assurance, management anticipates that
 results from the acquired companies will significantly improve during 1999 due
 to, among other things, the absence of the factors causing disruption and
 insufficient focus at these three companies during 1998.
 
          Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 1998 were
 $1,836.9 million, an increase of $763.8 million versus the year ended December
 28, 1997. After excluding: (i) $1,009.0 million of sales generated by the
 acquired entities, as discussed above; (ii) $5.5 million of sales in 1998
 resulting from the change in fiscal year end, as described in Note 1 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) $12.7 million in 1998 and $31.3 million
 in 1997 from sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which the inventory
 carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value; (iv) $4.2
 million from 1997 sales relating to divested product lines which are not
 classified as discontinued operations (time and temperature products and
 Counselor and Borg branded scales), and (v) a $5.4 million benefit in 1997 from
 the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required
 (cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining net
 sales), net sales on an adjusted basis ("Adjusted Sales") of $809.7 million
 decreased approximately 22% from Adjusted Sales of $1,032.2 million in 1997.
 Product sales were adversely impacted by a number of factors, with the largest
 being changes in retail inventory levels from channel loading which took place
 in 1997. The Company believes the year-to-year effect of such inventory
 reductions amounted to over $100 million. Additionally, losses in distribution
 of outdoor cooking products estimated at approximately $60 million, the
 estimated effect of price discounting on appliance and grill products of
 approximately $14 million, and estimated higher provisions for customer returns
 and allowances of approximately $30 million contributed to the lower sales in
 1998. The remaining sales decline was due in part to exiting certain product
 SKU's.
 
          Domestic Adjusted Sales declined approximately 21% or $170 million from
 1997. The Company believes more than half of the sales decline was due to
 increased retail inventory levels in 1997 versus decreased inventory positions
 at customers in 1998. Excluding this effect, sales were still lower than the
 prior year throughout the business, with the most significant decline occurring
 in outdoor cooking products sales. During 1997, the Company lost a significant
 portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority of
 its grill parts and accessories products distribution. The outdoor cooking
 products sales decline was attributable predominately to this lost distribution
 and to price discounting. The majority of the remaining sales decline was due to
 higher provisions for customer returns and allowances.
 
          International sales, which represented 22% of Adjusted Sales for 1998,
 decreased approximately 24% compared with the Adjusted Sales for the same period
 a year ago. The Company believes this sales decline was primarily attributable
 to decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with the prior year. Sales
 were also adversely impacted by a decision to stop selling to certain export
 distributors in Latin America and by poor economic conditions in that region. In
 addition, lost distribution in Canada contributed to the sales decline from the
 prior year.
 
          Excluding the effect of: (i) the gross margin generated from the
 inclusion of the acquired entities' operations in the period of $205.1 million,
 as discussed above; (ii) $0.8 million from the impact of the change in fiscal
 year-end; (iii) $128.4 million in 1998 in charges recorded in the second and
 fourth quarters related to excess inventory and fixed assets impairments; (iv)
 $15.8 million from the benefit in 1997 from the reversal of reserves no longer
 required, including $5.4 million of cooperative advertising accruals and (v) a
 $2.8 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 1997 resulting from
 capitalizing certain manufacturing supplies inventories which were previously
 expensed, there was a negative gross margin of $29.4 million for 1998 versus a
 gross margin of $223.5 million for 1997. Lower sales volume and unfavorable
 manufacturing efficiencies from lower production levels associated with the
 lower sales volumes and high inventory levels in 1998 accounted for
 approximately 55% of the change between years. Approximately 55% of the
 remaining decrease is attributable to lower price realization and higher costs
 of customer returns and allowances in 1998 and adverse product sales mix in
 1998. The adverse product sales mix was due
 
                                        22
 <PAGE>
 
 in part to the loss of a majority of the grill accessory products distribution
 as accessories generate significantly better margins than the average margins on
 sales of most of the Company's other products. Costs associated with a blanket
 recall, higher warranty reserves and inventory adjustments due in part to
 physical inventories drove the remaining decrease in gross margin.
 
          Excluding the effect of: (i) $329.9 million of SG&A charges in the
 acquired entities, including the $62.5 million goodwill write-off related to
 First Alert; (ii) $70.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 1998 related to
 the issuance of warrants; (iii) $2.3 million of SG&A expense in 1998 from the
 change in the fiscal period; (iv) a $5.9 million benefit in 1998 and a $12.1
 million benefit in 1997 from the reversal of reserves no longer required; (v)
 approximately $31 million of 1998 compensation expense recorded in connection
 with new employment agreements with the Company's former Chairman and Chief
 Executive Officer and two other former senior officers and approximately $3
 million of severance in 1998 for certain former employees; (vi) $20.4 million,
 $6.1 million, and $4.0 million of costs recorded in 1998 related to costs
 associated with the restatement efforts, Year 2000 compliance efforts and a
 corporate office relocation, respectively, and (vii) $15.8 million of
 restructuring related charges recorded in 1997, SG&A expenses were approximately
 $257 million in 1998, 71% higher than the same period in 1997. This increase of
 approximately $108 million is due to several factors. Corporate administrative
 costs increased by approximately $47 million, reflecting additional personnel
 and related relocation, travel and other costs, as well as increased outside
 provider fees, telecommunications expense and insurance. Higher allowances for
 accounts receivable in 1998, accounting for approximately $20 million of the
 increase, related primarily to collection issues with certain customers in the
 U.S. and in Latin America, including several major customers who have filed
 and/or threatened bankruptcy. Advertising, marketing and selling expenses
 increased by approximately $13 million, reflecting a national television
 campaign for grills and increased activity in market research, package design
 and sales efforts. Higher inventory levels in 1998 and costs associated with
 outsourcing small parts fulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousing
 costs of approximately $12 million. Increased environmental reserves for
 divested and closed facilities added approximately $5 million while settlement
 of a patent infringement action resulted in additional expense of approximately
 $4 million.
 
          During 1997, the Company determined that the amounts accrued at
 December 29, 1996 for Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges recorded in
 fiscal 1996 exceeded amounts ultimately required. Accordingly, the 1997
 Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the reversal of accruals no longer
 required, resulting in a Restructuring and Asset Impairment Benefit of $14.6
 million. This reversal was reflected in the third ($5.8 million) and fourth
 ($8.8 million) quarters of 1997 when it became evident that such accruals were
 no longer required.
 
          Operating results for 1998 and 1997, on an adjusted basis as described
 above, were a loss of approximately $286 million in 1998 and a profit of
 approximately $74 million in 1997. This change resulted from the factors
 discussed above.
 
          Interest expense increased from $11.4 million for the twelve months of
 1997 to $131.1 million for the same period in 1998. Approximately 70% of the
 change related to higher borrowing levels in 1998 for the acquisitions, with the
 remainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital, capital
 expenditures and the operating losses.
 
          Other income, net increased in 1998 by $4.8 million due to
 approximately $8 million from the settlement of a lawsuit, and approximately $4
 million of increased net gains from foreign exchange in the period. The foreign
 exchange net gains were primarily from Mexico. Increased losses on sales of
 fixed assets of approximately $5 million and increased expenses related to the
 New Credit Facility partially offset the above mentioned income. The increased
 credit facility expenses largely related to unused facility fees.
 
          The minority interest reported in 1998 relates to the minority interest
 held in Coleman by public shareholders.
 
          During 1998, the current tax provision arose largely from taxes on the
 earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as franchise taxes. Deferred tax
 benefits were recognized in 1998 principally due to net operating losses
 incurred subsequent to the acquisitions. These benefits were realized through
 the use of deferred tax credits that were established in connection with the
 acquisitions to the extent that such credits are expected to be realized in the
 loss carryforward period. During 1998, the Company increased the income tax
 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to $290.5 million. This increase
 reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that these
 deferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income. The 1997
 effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate
 primarily due to state taxes, the effects of foreign earnings and dividends
 taxed at other rates and the impact of providing a valuation allowance on
 deferred tax assets.
 
          In 1998, the Company prepaid certain debt assumed in the acquisitions
 and prepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility. In
 connection with these early extinguishments of debt, the Company recognized an
 extraordinary charge of $122.4 million, consisting primarily of redemption
 premiums.
 
                                        23

          The Company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March
 1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
 sale and nominal earnings for that period. As a result of the sale of the
 Company's furniture business assets (primarily inventory, property, plant and
 equipment), the Company received $69.0 million in cash, retained approximately
 $50 million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities. The final
 purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post-closing
 adjustment based on the terms of the sale agreement and in the first quarter of
 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss on
 disposal of $14.0 million, net of applicable income tax benefits of $8.5
 million.
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996
 
 1996 RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND OTHER CHARGES AND BENEFITS
 
          In November 1996, the Company announced the details of a restructuring
 plan. The plan included the consolidation of administrative functions, the
 reduction of manufacturing and warehouse facilities, the centralization of the
 Company's procurement function and the reduction of the Company's product
 offerings and SKU's. The restructuring plan also included the elimination of
 certain businesses and product lines.
 
          As part of the restructuring plan, the Company consolidated six
 divisional and regional headquarters functions into a single worldwide corporate
 headquarters and outsourced certain back office activities resulting in a
 reduction in total back-office/administrative headcount. Overall, the
 restructuring plan called for a reduction in the number of production facilities
 from 26 to 8 and the elimination of over 6,000 positions from the Company's
 workforce, including 3,300 from the disposition of certain business operations
 and the elimination of approximately 2,800 other positions, some of which were
 outsourced. The Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan by
 July 1997.
 
          In conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring plan, the
 Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $239.2 million in the fourth quarter of
 1996. This amount is recorded as follows in the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations: $110.1 million recorded in Restructuring and Asset Impairment
 Charges, as further described below; $60.8 million in Cost of Goods Sold related
 principally to inventory write-downs as a result of a reduction in SKU's and
 costs of inventory liquidation programs; $10.1 million in SG&A expense, for
 period costs principally relating to outsourcing and package redesign, and $58.2
 million ($39.1 million net of taxes) in Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations
 related to the divestiture of its furniture business. In 1997, upon completion
 of the sale of the furniture business, the Company recorded an additional
 pre-tax loss of $22.5 million from discontinued operations ($14.0 million net of
 taxes) due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds relating to the
 post closing adjustment process that was part of the sale agreement.
 
          Amounts included in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in 1996
 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations included anticipated
 cash charges such as severance and other employee costs of $24.7 million, lease
 obligations of $12.6 million and other exit costs associated with facility
 closures and related to the implementation of the restructuring plan of $4.1
 million, principally representing costs related to clean-up and restoration of
 facilities for either sale or return to the landlord.
 
          Included in Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in 1996 was
 $68.7 million of non-cash charges principally consisting of: (a) asset
 write-downs to net realizable value for disposals of excess facilities and
 equipment and certain product lines ($22.5 million); (b) write-offs of redundant
 computer systems from the administrative back-office consolidations and
 outsourcing initiatives ($12.3 million); (c) write-off of intangibles relating
 to discontinued product lines ($10.1 million); (d) write-off of capitalized
 product and package design costs and other expenses related to exited product
 lines and SKU reductions ($9.0 million), and (e) losses related to the
 divestiture of certain non-core products and businesses ($14.8 million). The
 asset write-downs of $34.8 million included equipment taken out of service in
 1996 (either abandoned in 1996 or sold in 1997) and accordingly, depreciation
 was not recorded subsequent to the date of the impairment charge. The losses of
 $14.8 million related to the divestiture of non-core products and businesses
 resulted from divesting of the time and temperature business (sold in March
 1997) and Counselor and Borg scale product lines (sold in May 1997) and the sale
 of the textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in May 1997. These charges primarily
 represented the estimated non-cash loss to exit these products, including fixed
 assets and inventory write-downs and other costs related to exiting these
 product lines.
 
          The $24.7 million for severance and other employee costs, including
 COBRA and other fringe benefits, related to approximately 3,700 positions that
 were planned to be eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan, excluding
 approximately 2,400 employees terminated from the furniture business for which
 severance was included in Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations (see Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The furniture business was sold
 in 1997. In 1996 and 1997, approximately 1,200 employees and 1,800 employees,
 respectively, were terminated from continuing operations. 
 
                                        24
 <PAGE>
 
 Due largely to attrition, the remaining planned terminations were not required.
 In 1997, the Company determined that its severance and related employee costs
 were less than originally accrued principally due to lower than expected
 severance and COBRA costs and, accordingly, reversed accruals of $7.9 million in
 the third and fourth quarters. At December 31, 1997, the balance accrued of $1.2
 million represented the remaining severance and related employee costs for
 certain employees terminated during 1997. During 1998, all amounts were
 expended.
 
          The amounts accrued at December 29, 1996 for Restructuring and Asset
 Impairment Charges recorded in fiscal 1996, exceeded amounts ultimately required
 principally due to reductions in anticipated severance costs of $7.9 million, as
 discussed above, and reductions in estimated lease payments of $6.7 million
 resulting from better than anticipated rentals received under sub-leases and
 favorable negotiation of lease terminations. Accordingly, the fiscal 1997
 Consolidated Statement of Operations included $14.6 million of benefit ($5.8
 million in the third quarter and $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1997)
 related to the reversal of accruals no longer required, which were recorded as
 these reduced obligations became known.
 
          In 1996, in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan,
 the Company recorded additional charges totaling $129.1 million, reflected in
 Cost of Goods Sold, SG&A expense, and Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations.
 The charge included in Cost of Goods Sold ($60.8 million) principally
 represented inventory write-downs and anticipated losses on the disposition of
 the inventory as a result of the significant reduction in SKU's provided for in
 the restructuring plan. The write-down included $26.9 million related to raw
 materials, work-in process and finished goods for discontinued outdoor cooking
 products, principally grills and grill accessories and the balance related to
 raw materials, work-in process and finished goods for other discontinued
 products including appliances, clippers and blankets. SG&A expense included
 period costs in 1997 and 1996 of $15.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively,
 relating to employee relocation and recruiting, outsourcing, equipment movement
 and package redesign costs expended as a result of the implementation of the
 restructuring plan. The 1996 Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations related to
 the divestiture of the Company's furniture business. In 1996, the Company
 decided to divest its furniture operations and recorded an estimated pre-tax
 loss of $58.2 million related to the sale of assets, primarily fixed assets and
 inventory. In 1997, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax loss of $22.5
 million due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds resulting from
 the post closing adjustment process as provided for in the sales agreement. (See
 Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
          At December 28, 1997, the Company had $5.2 million in liabilities
 accrued related to the 1996 restructuring plan, including $1.2 million of
 severance related costs and $4.0 million related to facility closures, which
 principally represented future lease payments (net of sub-leases) on exited
 facilities. During 1998, this liability was reduced by $4.0 million as a result
 of cash expenditures. At December 28, 1997, the Company had $3.0 million of
 warranty liabilities related to the discontinued furniture operations. During
 1998, $2.5 million of this liability was liquidated.

          At December 29, 1996, the net realizable value of the remaining
 inventory written-down as part of the restructuring and asset impairment charges
 was approximately $37.3 million. During 1997, this inventory, a portion of which
 was product of discontinued operations, was sold for amounts substantially
 equivalent to its net carrying value.
 
          As further discussed in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
 Statements, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company charged SG&A expense
 for increases of $9.0 million in environmental reserves and $12.0 million in
 litigation reserves. In the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company performed a
 comprehensive review of all environmental exposures in an attempt by the then
 new senior management team to accelerate the resolution and settlement of
 environmental claims. As a result, upon the conclusion of the review, the
 Company recorded additional environmental reserves of $9.0 million in the fourth
 quarter of 1996. The litigation charge of $12.0 million was recorded due to an
 unfavorable court ruling in January 1997, which held that the Company was liable
 for environmental remediation costs related to the operations of a successor
 company. As a result of this ruling, the Company provided for this liability in
 the fourth quarter of 1996. In 1997, this case was settled and, as a result,
 $8.1 million of the charge was reversed into income, primarily in the fourth
 quarter of 1997.
 
          As described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
 the Company also charged $7.7 million to SG&A expenses in 1996 for compensation
 costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the
 employment of the then new senior management team.
 
          During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 1997,
 approximately $0.5 million, $4.5 million, $1.5 million and $21.5 million,
 respectively, of pre-tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to
 be no longer required were reversed and taken into income. These amounts were
 primarily related to the litigation reserve ($8.1 million) discussed above,
 inventory valuation allowances ($7.0 million), cooperative advertising
 allowances ($5.4 million), liabilities for exiting of facilities and plant
 consolidations provided for prior to 1996 ($3.5 million) and consulting fee
 accruals ($1.3 million). These liabilities were provided for by the Company,
 principally in 1996, based upon its best available estimate at the time of the
 probable liabilities. When information became available that the amounts
 provided were in excess of what was required, the Company appropriately reduced
 the applicable reserves and recorded increases in Net Sales ($5.4 million),
 reductions in Cost of Goods Sold ($10.5 million) and reductions in SG&A expenses
 ($12.1 million).

          Additionally, effective in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the
 Company changed its method of accounting to capitalize manufacturing supplies
 inventories, whereas, previously these inventories were charged to operations
 when purchased. This change reduced Cost of Goods Sold in fiscal 1997 by $2.8
 million.
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 1997 COMPARED TO 1996
 
          Net sales for 1997 were $1,073.1 million, an increase of $88.9 million
 or 9% over 1996. After excluding: (i) $4.2 million and $30.8 million in 1997 and
 1996, respectively, related to divested product lines which are not classified
 as discontinued operations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding
 and Counselor and Borg branded scales), (ii) $31.3 million of sales in 1997 of
 discontinued inventory which resulted primarily from the reduction of SKU's as
 part of the 1996 restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying value
 was substantially equivalent to the sales value, and (iii) a $5.4 million
 benefit from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer
 required in 1997, Adjusted Sales increased 8% over the prior year to $1,032.2
 million from $953.4 million in 1996.
 
          Adjusted Sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during 1997 primarily
 from new product introductions, expanded distribution (particularly with the
 Company's top ten customers), international geographic expansion and increased
 inventory positions at certain customers. Adjusted Sales growth was
 approximately 19% for appliances and approximately 12% in outdoor cooking.
 Adjusted Sales for health products increased approximately 5% while Adjusted
 Sales of personal care products and blankets decreased approximately 13% during
 1997.
 
          Sales increases in appliances of approximately $69 million, were driven
 by new products, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons,
 deep fryers and toasters, coupled with increased distribution with large
 national mass retailers, combined with higher inventory levels at certain
 customers. Sales of outdoor cooking products increased approximately $30 million
 in 1997 attributed to increased merchandising and advertising programs, new
 distribution and higher inventory levels at certain customers. During 1997, the
 Company lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution,
 including the majority of its grill accessory products distribution.
 Accessories, which accounted for just over 10% of the outdoor cooking sales
 volume in 1997, generate significantly better margins than the average margins
 on sales of grills. These distribution changes are expected to adversely impact
 outdoor cooking sales and margins in the future, until such time as the
 distribution is regained.
 
          Sales of personal care products and blankets suffered during the fourth
 quarter of 1997 as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of
 electric blankets in key northern markets in late 1997 coupled with the
 inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages
 of blanket shells. This resulted in a sales decline of approximately $25 million
 as compared with the prior year. The Company shifted to a more level production
 for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for
 bedding products. Sales of health products as well as personal care and bedding
 products were impacted by increased inventory positions at customers in 1997.
 
          International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997,
 grew 25% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220
 volt product introductions and a general improvement in demand in export
 operations and in Mexico. Net sales growth of approximately 35% was achieved in
 the Latin American export sales organization. Most of this growth came from
 increased business with three exporters. In Mexico and Venezuela, sales grew 30%
 and 24%, respectively. Canada accounted for the majority of the remaining
 international sales growth.
 
          Excluding the effect of: (i) charges to Cost of Goods Sold related to
 the restructuring plan in 1996 ($60.8 million), (ii) the benefit of reducing
 reserves no longer required in 1997 ($15.9 million), and (iii) the benefit in
 1997 of capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories ($2.8 million), gross
 margin as a percent of Adjusted Sales would have been approximately 22% in 1997,
 an improvement of approximately 6 percentage points from 16% in 1996. This
 increase reflects the results of lower overhead spending, improved factory
 utilization and labor cost benefits resulting from the Company's restructuring
 plan, coupled with reductions in certain materials costs. The lower overhead
 spending resulted from a reduction in the number of facilities operated by the
 Company. With fewer facilities used for production purposes, the capacity of the
 remaining plants was more fully utilized. The labor cost benefits were realized
 principally from shifting production to Mexico. In addition, a broad based
 program to obtain lower costs for materials contributed to the 1997 margin
 improvement.
 
          Excluding the impact of: (i) the restructuring and asset impairment
 period costs to SG&A expense in 1997 ($15.8 million) and 1996 ($10.1 million),
 (ii) the 1996 charges for the environmental accrual ($9.0 million), litigation
 accrual ($12.0 million), and
 
                                        27
 <PAGE>
 
 restricted stock grant compensation ($7.7 million), and (iii) the 1997 benefit
 from the reversal of reserves no longer required ($12.1 million), SG&A expense
 improved to 14% of Adjusted Sales in 1997, down 5 percentage points from 19% in
 1996. This improvement was partially the result of benefits from the
 consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate
 headquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels,
 a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company-wide cost control
 initiatives. Higher expenditures in 1996 for market research, new packaging and
 other discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with certain
 of the Company's customers also contributed to the decrease in SG&A expenses
 from 1996 to 1997. The expense for doubtful accounts and cash discounts was
 $17.3 million in 1997 as compared to $27.1 million in 1996. The principal factor
 in the decrease in bad debt expenses during this period was the acceleration of
 the consolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the related competitive
 environment, which resulted in a number of troubled retailers and related
 bankruptcies during 1996. This resulted in the significant amount of bad debt
 write-offs ($19.9 million) in 1996.
 
          Operating results for 1997 and 1996, on a comparable basis as described
 above, were earnings of $74.5 million in 1997 and a loss of $34.8 million in
 1996. On the same basis, operating margin increased 11 percentage points to 7%
 of Adjusted Sales in 1997 versus a loss of 4% in 1996. This improvement resulted
 from the factors discussed above.
 
          Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million
 in 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997.
 
          The 1997 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higher
 than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes plus the
 effect of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the increase
 to the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by the reversal
 of tax liabilities no longer required. In the fourth quarter of 1997, the
 Company increased the valuation allowance by $23.2 million reflecting
 management's assessment that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax
 asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Of this amount, $18.9
 million related to deferred tax assets, the majority of which was recognized as
 a benefit in the first three quarters of 1997. The remainder related to minimum
 pension liabilities and was therefore recorded as an adjustment to shareholders'
 equity. This assessment was made as a result of the significant leverage
 undertaken by the Company as part of the acquisitions and the significant
 decline in net sales and earnings from anticipated levels during the fourth
 quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. For 1996, the effective income
 tax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income tax
 rate.
 
          The Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was
 $0.60 per share in 1997 versus a loss per share from continuing operations in
 1996 of $2.05. The Company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per
 share calculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an
 increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the exercise
 of stock options in 1997 and the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the
 1997 calculation. 
 
          The Company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in March
 1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
 sale and nominal earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture business had net
 income of $0.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated loss on
 disposal of the business of $39.1 million, net of applicable income tax
 benefits. The sale of the Company's furniture business assets (primarily
 inventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March 1997. The
 Company received $69.0 million in cash, retained approximately $50.0 million in
 accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities related to the furniture
 business. The final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a
 post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the asset purchase agreement and
 in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company recorded
 an additional loss on disposal of $22.5 million pre-tax. Although the
 discontinued furniture business was profitable, net income had declined from
 $21.7 million in 1994 to $0.8 million in 1996. This decline, along with the
 Company's announcement that it intended to divest this line of business
 contributed to the loss on the sale. See discussion of restructuring and asset
 impairment (benefit) charges in Note 12 and discontinued operations in Note 13
 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding
 sale of the furniture business.

 </TABLE>
 
          After consideration of the adjustments above, 1998 and 1996 results
 from continuing operations reflect losses and 1997 continuing operations are
 marginally profitable. Due to a variety of factors, including increased
 inventory positions at certain customers and manufacturing and sourcing
 activities during 1997 and the first half of 1998 which increased the Company's
 inventory position, the results for each of 1998 and 1997 are not indicative of
 future results. Results for 1999 are expected to be impacted by the continuing
 effects of the Company's excess inventory position, as well as costs related to
 Year 2000 compliance efforts.
 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
          Approximately 80% of the Company's business is conducted in U.S.
 dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,
 primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of
 European sales). The Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made
 principally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.
 Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997;
 therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets are
 included as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not considered
 hyperinflationary as of January 1, 1999. This change in Mexico's
 hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the
 Company's financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from the
 Company's non-U.S. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on
 the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
          While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not been
 significant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative
 effect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in Latin
 America have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales in
 and exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as the economic
 environments in those regions remain unsettled.

          On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures that
 arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered into
 for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had a
 material impact on the Company's financial results. (See Note 4 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
 EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK
 
 QUALITATIVE INFORMATION
 
          The Company uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to
 manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not
 speculate on interest rates or foreign currency rates. Instead, it uses
 derivatives when implementing its risk management strategies to reduce the
 possible effects of these exposures.
 
          With respect to foreign currency exposures, the Company is most
 vulnerable to changes in rates between the United States dollar/Japanese yen,
 Canadian dollar, German deutschmark, Mexican peso and Venezuelan bolivar
 exchange rates. The Company principally uses forward and option contracts to
 reduce risks arising from firm commitments, intercompany sales transactions and
 intercompany receivable and payable balances. The Company generally uses
 interest rate swaps to fix certain of its variable rate debt. The Company
 manages credit risk related to these derivative contracts through credit
 approvals, exposure limits and threshold amounts and other monitoring
 procedures.
 
 QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION
 
          Set forth below are tabular presentations of certain information
 related to Sunbeam's investments in market risk sensitive instruments. All of
 the instruments set forth in the following tables have been entered into by the
 Company for purposes other than trading purposes.
 
 INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
 
           The table below provides information about the Company's derivative
 financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to
 changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations.
 
          For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by
 expected maturity date and related (weighted) December 31, 1998 average interest
 rates. Included in the debt position are the Debentures, which carry no
 intervening cash flows but mature in 2018. For interest rate swaps, the table
 presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates for the contracts
 at the current time. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual
 payments to be exchanged under the contracts.

 (1)      The fair value of fixed rate debt is estimated using either reported transaction values or discounted cash flow analysis. 
          The carrying value of variable rate debt is assumed to approximate market value based on the periodic adjustments of the 
          interest rates to the current market rates in accordance with the terms of the agreements. The fair value of the interest 
          rate swaps is based on estimates of the cost of terminating the swaps.
 (2)      The total amount of Debentures maturing in future periods exceeds the balance as of December 31, 1998 due to the accretion
          of the Debentures. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY  
 
          The table below provides information about Sunbeam's derivative
 financial instruments, other financial instruments and forward exchange
 agreements by functional currency and presents such information in U.S. dollar
 equivalents. The table summarizes information on instruments and transactions
 that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign
 currency variable rate credit lines, foreign currency forward exchange
 agreements and foreign currency purchased put option contracts. For debt
 obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted
 average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For foreign currency forward
 exchange agreements and foreign currency put option contracts, the table

 EURO CONVERSION
 
          On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union
 established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
 European Union's common currency (the "Euro"). The transition period for the
 introduction of the Euro is between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. The
 Company has been preparing for the introduction of the Euro and continues to
 evaluate and address the many issues involved, including the conversion of
 information technology systems, recalculating currency risk, strategies
 concerning continuity of contracts, and impacts on the processes for preparing
 taxation and accounting records. Based on the work to date, the Company believes
 the Euro conversion will not have a material impact on its results of
 operations.
 
 SEASONALITY
 
          Sunbeam's sales, prior to the acquisitions, have not traditionally
 exhibited substantial seasonality; however, sales have been strongest during the
 fourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of outdoor cooking
 products are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of appliances,
 personal care and blanket products are strongest in the second half of the year.
 After considering the seasonality of the acquired entities, Sunbeam's
 consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial seasonality; however,
 sales are expected to be strongest during the second quarter of the calendar
 year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products, including warming blankets,
 vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alert products, camping and generator
 products may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
          In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert and
 Signature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the
 Company and the three acquired entities, the Company consummated an offering of
 Debentures at a yield to maturity of 5% (approximately $2,014 million principal
 amount at maturity) in March 1998, which resulted in approximately $730 million
 of net proceeds and entered into the New Credit Facility.
 
          The Debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company's common
 stock at an initial conversion rate of 6.575 shares for each $1,000 principal
 amount at maturity of the Debentures, subject to adjustment upon occurrence of
 certain events. The Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all
 existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The Debentures are not
 redeemable by the Company prior to March 25, 2003. On or after such date, the
 Debentures are redeemable for cash with at least 30 days notice, at the option
 of the Company. The Company is required to purchase Debentures at the option of
 the holder as of March 25, 2003, March 25, 2008 and March 25, 2013, at purchase
 prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.
 The Company may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or
 common stock or any combination thereof. The Company was required to file a
 registration statement with the SEC to register the Debentures by June 23, 1998.
 This registration statement was filed on February 4, 1999 and the SEC has not
 declared the registration statement effective. Sunbeam's failure to file the
 registration statement by June 23, 1998 did not constitute default under the
 terms of the Debentures. As part of the normal review process by the SEC, a
 number of comments have been made by the staff of the division of Corporation
 Finance relating to the registration statement and the restated 1996 and 1997
 financial statements included therein. The Company expects to resolve these
 comments when it files an amendment to the registration statement. From June 23,
 1998 until the registration statement is declared effective, the Company is
 required to pay to the Debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, for
 each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% during the first
 90 days and 0.50% thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the
 Debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Company
 made its first payment of approximately $0.5 million to the Debenture holders on
 September 25, 1998 and an additional $2.0 million was paid on March 25, 1999.
 
          Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its $250 million
 syndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the New Credit
 Facility. The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to
 $1.7 billion. As a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal 1998, among
 other things, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants set forth
 in the New Credit Facility. The Company and its lenders entered into agreements
 as of June 30, 1998, October 19, 1998 and April 10, 1999, in each case providing
 for waivers of compliance with such covenants under the New Credit Facility.
 Effective April 15, 1999, Sunbeam and its lenders entered into an agreement
 which waived compliance with such covenants through April 10, 2000 and provided
 for new financial covenants. The following description of the New Credit
 Facility reflects the terms of the New Credit Facility as amended through April
 15, 1999.
 
          The New Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to $1.7
 billion pursuant to: (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
 amount of up to $400.0 million maturing March 30, 2005 ($52.5 million of which
 may only be used to complete the Coleman merger if the Coleman merger is not
 completed prior to August 31, 1999); (ii) $800.0 million in term loans maturing
 on March 30, 2005 (of which $35.0 million may only be used to complete the
 Coleman merger) and (iii) a $500.0 million term loan maturing September 30,
 2006. As of December 31, 1998, approximately $1.4 billion was outstanding and
 approximately $0.3 billion was available for borrowing under the New Credit
 Facility.
 
          Pursuant to the New Credit Facility, interest accrues, at the Company's
 option: (i) at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or (ii) at the base
 rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime
 commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate
 plus 0.50%, in each case plus an agreed upon interest margin which is currently
 3.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 2.50% for base rate borrowings. The applicable
 interest margin is subject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of certain
 events. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by a pledge of the
 stock of the Company's material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by a
 security interest in substantially all of the assets of Sunbeam and its material
 domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiaries except
 as described below. Currently, Coleman's inventory and related assets are
 pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account
 under the New Credit Facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman's note
 payable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic
 assets, other than real property, including 66% of the stock of its direct
 foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign
 subsidiaries, and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries
 (but not the assets of Coleman's subsidiaries). The pledge runs in favor of
 Sunbeam's lending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as security
 for Sunbeam's obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,
 substantially all of Coleman's assets and the assets of Coleman's domestic
 subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the New Credit
 Facility. In addition, borrowings under the New Credit Facility are guaranteed
 by a number of the Company's wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries and
 these subsidiary
 
                                        32
 <PAGE>
 
 guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion of the Coleman
 merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries will become
 guarantors of the obligations under the New Credit Facility. To the extent
 borrowings are made by any subsidiaries of the Company, the obligations of such
 subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company.
 
          The New Credit Facility contains covenants customary for credit
 facilities of a similar nature, including limitations on the ability of Sunbeam
 and its subsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things, (i) declare
 dividends or repurchase stock, (ii) prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur
 liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions, (iii) make loans and
 investments, (iv) incur additional debt, (v) amend or otherwise alter material
 agreements or enter into restrictive agreements, (vi) make capital and year 2000
 compliance expenditures, (vii) engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales,
 (viii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (ix) settle certain
 litigation, (x) alter its cash management system and (xi) alter the businesses
 they conduct. Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial
 covenants and ratios. The New Credit Facility provides for events of default
 customary for transactions of this type, including nonpayment,
 misrepresentation, breach of covenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material
 adverse change arising from compliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments,
 entering into guarantees and change of ownership and control. It is also an
 event of default under the New Credit Facility if Sunbeam's registration
 statement in connection with the Coleman merger is not declared effective by the
 SEC on or before October 30, 1999 or if the merger does not occur within 25
 business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash
 consideration (including any payments on account of the exercise of any
 appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customary
 fees and expenses) to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds $87.5 million.
 Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfy
 these conditions. Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure to satisfy
 these requirements (as with the occurrence of any other event of default) would
 permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings
 under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility also includes provisions
 for the deferral of the 1999 scheduled term loan payments of $69.3 million,
 subject to delivery of certain collateral documents and the filing of an
 amendment to the Company's registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the
 Coleman merger. If these conditions are met, and there are no events of default,
 the scheduled loan payments will be extended until April 10, 2000. The Company
 anticipates that it will satisfy these conditions and, accordingly, has
 classified these amounts as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
          As of December 31, 1998, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
 $61.4 million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of $427.1
 million and total debt of $2.3 billion. Cash used in operating activities during
 1998 was $190.4 million compared to $6.0 million used in operating activities in
 1997. This change is primarily attributable to lower earnings after giving
 effect to non-cash charges partially offset by improvements in working capital.
 During 1998, $184.2 million in cash was generated by reducing receivables,
 including the effects of the securitization program described below, and
 reducing inventories, which was partially offset by a $68.2 million reduction in
 accounts payable levels. In the fourth quarter of 1998, cash provided by
 operating activities totaled $34.3 million, principally due to cash generated by
 reducing receivables and inventories of $181.9 million, partially offset by the
 previously discussed reduction in earnings. The decrease in cash provided by
 operations from 1996 to 1997 is primarily attributable to increased inventory
 levels in 1997 and spending in 1997 related to the restructuring initiatives
 accrued for in 1996, largely offset by an increase in cash generated by earnings
 in 1997 and an income tax refund (net of payments) in 1997. Cash used in
 operating activities reflects proceeds of $200.0 million in 1998 and $58.9
 million in 1997 from the Company's revolving trade accounts receivable
 securitization program, as more fully described below.
 
          Cash used in investing activities in 1998 reflects $522.4 million for
 the acquisitions. In 1997, cash provided by investing activities reflected $91.0
 million in proceeds from the sales of divested operations and other assets.
 Capital spending totaled $53.7 million in 1998 and was primarily for
 manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment and tooling for new products,
 and management information systems hardware and software licenses. The new
 product capital spending principally related to the air and water filtration
 products which were discontinued in the second quarter of 1998, electric
 blankets, grills, clippers and appliances. Capital spending in 1997 was $60.5
 million and was primarily attributable to manufacturing capacity expansion, cost
 reduction initiatives and equipment to manufacture new products. The new product
 capital spending in 1997 principally related to appliances and included costs
 related to blenders, toasters, stand mixers, slow cookers and a soft serve ice
 cream product. Capital spending in 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5
 million related to the discontinued furniture business) and was primarily
 attributable to equipment for new product development and cost reduction
 initiatives. The Company anticipates 1999 capital spending to be approximately
 3% of net sales, primarily related to new product introductions, capacity
 additions, certain facility rationalization initiatives and systems hardware and
 software. As discussed above, the Company's capital and Year 2000 compliance
 expenditures are limited under the terms of the New Credit Facility.
 
          Cash provided by financing activities totaled $766.2 million in 1998
 and reflects the net proceeds from the sale of Debentures of $729.6 million, the
 cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the Company's $250
 million September 1996 revolving credit facility, the repayment of certain debt
 acquired with the acquisitions, the early extinguishment of the $75.0 million
 Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond and net borrowings under the New Credit
 Facility. In addition, cash provided by financing activities during 1998
 includes $19.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock
 
                                        33
 <PAGE>
 
 options. During 1997, cash provided by financing activities of $16.4 million
 reflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company's September 1996
 revolving credit facility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the
 divested furniture business and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash
 proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In 1996, cash provided by financing
 activities of $45.3 million was primarily from increased revolving credit
 facility borrowings of $30.0 million to support working capital and capital
 spending requirements, $11.5 million in new issuances of long-term debt and $4.6
 million in proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to certain executives of
 the Company.
 
          In December 1997, the Company entered into a revolving trade accounts
 receivable securitization program, which as amended expires in March 2000, to
 sell without recourse, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, certain trade accounts
 receivable, up to a maximum of $70 million. The Company, as agent for the
 purchaser of the receivables, retains collection and administrative
 responsibilities for the purchased receivables. For the year ended December 31,
 1998, the Company had sold approximately $200 million of accounts receivable
 under this program. At December 31, 1998, the Company had reduced accounts
 receivable by $20.0 million for receivables sold under this program. The Company
 expects to continue the securitization program to finance a portion of its
 accounts receivable. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
          At December 31, 1998, standby and commercial letters of credit
 aggregated $82.3 million and were predominately for insurance, pension,
 environmental, workers' compensation, and international trade activities. In
 addition, as of December 31, 1998, surety bonds with a contract value of $26.5
 million were outstanding largely as a result of litigation judgements that are
 currently under appeal.
 
          For additional information relating to the Debentures, the New Credit
 Facility and the repayment of certain debt, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements.
 
          The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman
 pursuant to a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority
 shareholders will receive 0.5677 share of the Company's common stock and $6.44
 in cash for each share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition,
 unexercised options under Coleman's stock option plans will be cashed out at a
 price per share equal to the difference between $27.50 and the exercise price of
 such options. The Company expects to issue approximately 6.7 million shares of
 common stock and expend approximately $87 million in cash, including cash paid
 to option holders, to complete the Coleman transaction. (See Notes 2 and 15 of
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Although there can be no assurance,
 it is anticipated that the Coleman merger will occur in the second half of
 fiscal 1999.
 
          The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings,
 substantially all related to previously divested operations and to Coleman
 sites. In management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental
 matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial
 condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 15 of Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
          The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the New Credit
 Facility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquired
 companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable
 securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,
 capital and Year 2000 compliance spending, and debt service through April 10,
 2000. However, if the Company is unable to obtain a further waiver of the
 covenant and ratio requirements prior to April 10, 2000, the Company expects it
 would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the New Credit
 Facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require the repayment of
 all amounts then outstanding under the New Credit Facility.
 
          By letter dated June 17, 1998, the staff of the Division of Enforcement
 of the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry into
 the Company's accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Company
 produce certain documents. On July 2, 1998, the SEC issued a Formal Order of
 Private Investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to
 which a subpoena duces tecum was served on the Company requiring the production
 of certain documents. On November 4, 1998, the Company received another SEC
 subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of further documents. The Company
 has provided numerous documents to the SEC staff and continues to cooperate
 fully with the SEC staff. The Company cannot predict the term of such
 investigation or its potential outcome.

          The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class and
 derivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of its
 consolidated financial statements, the issuance of the M&F warrants, the sale of
 the Debentures and the employment agreements, attorney fees and expenses of
 Messrs. Dunlap and Kersh. The Company intends to vigorously defend each of the
 actions, but cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate
 the likelihood of the Company's success in each case or the range of potential
 loss. However, if these actions were determined adversely to the Company, such
 judgements would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
 position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the Company's
 insurance carriers have filed various suits requesting a declaratory judgement
 that the directors' and officers' liability insurance policies for excess
 coverage was invalid and/or had been properly cancelled by the carriers or have
 advised the Company of their intent to deny coverage under such policies. The
 Company intends to pursue recovery from all of its insurers if damages are
 rewarded against the Company or its indemnified officers and/or directors under
 any of the foregoing actions. The Company's failure to obtain such insurance
 recoveries following an adverse judgement against the Company on any of the
 foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
          The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuits
 from time to time that the Company considers to be ordinary routine litigation
 incidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution of
 these routine matters, and of certain matters relating to prior operations,
 individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the
 financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
 
          For additional information relating to litigation, see also Item 3 -
 "Legal Proceedings."
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
          In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
 ("AICPA") issued Statement of Position 98-1, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF
 COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE ("SOP 98-1"). SOP 98-1
 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be
 expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. The Company
 will adopt SOP 98-1 on January 1, 1999. Adoption of this statement is not
 expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
 position, results of operations, or cash flows. Actual charges incurred due to
 systems projects may be material.
 
          In April 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-5, REPORTING
 ON THE COST OF START-UP ACTIVITIES ("SOP 98-5"). SOP 98-5 requires all costs
 associated with pre-opening, pre-operating and organization activities to be
 expensed as incurred. The Company will adopt SOP 98-5 beginning January 1, 1999.
 Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the
 Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
          In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
 INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 requires the recognition of all
 derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either assets or liabilities
 measured at fair value. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 for the 2000 fiscal
 year. The Company has not yet determined the impact SFAS No. 133 will have on
 its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
 YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
 
          The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year 2000 on its
 operations. Year 2000 issues could include potential problems in the information
 technology ("IT") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations and
 problems in the Company's products. Year 2000 system failures could affect
 routine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,
 order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. In
 addition, system failures could affect the Company's security, payroll
 operations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potential
 risks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequately
 address their own Year 2000 issues.
 
 SUNBEAM'S APPROACH TO YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
          While the Company's Year 2000 readiness planning has been underway for
 over one year, during the third quarter of 1998 the Company established a
 cross-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by three
 external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and
 to assist the Company in implementing its Year 2000 strategy. This team is
 sponsored by the Company's Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to the
 Company's Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The Audit Committee of the
 Board of Directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company's Year
 2000 readiness program.
 
                                        35
 <PAGE>
 
          The Year 2000 project team has developed a phased approach to identify
 and resolve Year 2000 issues with many of these activities conducted in
 parallel. The Company's approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are
 described below.
 
          PHASE 1 - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam's
 Year 2000 readiness program, the Company established a Year 2000 Program
 Management Office ("PMO") to centralize the management of all of the Company's
 Year 2000 projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,
 uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year 2000 issues.
 
          The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software
 systems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,
 telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year 2000
 problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,
 ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into the
 Company's Year 2000 database along with a determination of the item's level of
 criticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have a
 significant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company's Year 2000
 program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. All
 information relative to each item is being tracked in the Company's Year 2000
 database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth
 quarters of 1998. The Company has completed a review of the readiness of
 embedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the
 Company's products have Year 2000 date sensitive systems.
 
          PHASE 2 - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam's Year
 2000 readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (as
 necessary) those items identified during Phase 1 as requiring corrective action.
 
          Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that are
 critical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted by
 not being ready for any Year 2000 issues include, among others, purchases of
 materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payroll
 processing. Systems and applications that have been identified by Sunbeam to
 date as not currently Year 2000 ready and which are critical to Sunbeam's
 operations include its financial software systems, which process the order
 entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable,
 and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applications
 in the Company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehouse
 management applications. In 1997, the Company began implementing a uniform
 international business and accounting information system to improve internal
 reporting processes. Based upon representations from the manufacturer that the
 current version of this uniform information system is Year 2000 ready, the
 Company has been actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilize
 this uniform system to the Year 2000 ready version. A small number of other
 Company business locations are replacing their current non-Year 2000 ready
 systems with this new uniform system.
 
          The Company is also actively replacing and/or upgrading legacy business
 systems that are not Year 2000 ready, including those that use localized
 business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by the uniform
 business and accounting information system. With respect to the Company's non-IT
 systems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-line manufacturing
 hardware) the Company is actively analyzing these items to assess any Year 2000
 issues. To date, no material issues have been discovered, and the Company will
 continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items.
 
          Sunbeam plans to complete the corrective work described above with
 respect to its systems by the second quarter of 1999 with final testing and
 implementation of such systems occurring in the second and third quarters of
 1999.
 
          PHASE 3 - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phase
 of Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program which was initiated during the third
 and fourth quarters of 1998 is designed to assess and interact with the
 Company's customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,
 the Company surveyed 1,100 vendors and suppliers determined to be critical to
 the Company. Based on the survey, the Company believes that there is only a low
 to medium risk of Year 2000 issues for approximately one-third of its vendors;
 however, a small number of vendors have been identified as high risk (less than
 3%) and almost two-thirds of the vendors did not respond fully to the survey.
 The Company will continue its vendor evaluation and assessment process through
 1999, including direct contact with high and medium risk vendors and vendors who
 have not responded fully to the Company's survey. The Company has not
 independently verified the responses of vendors and does not anticipate
 undertaking such independent verification process.
 
          Beginning in the second quarter of 1999, Sunbeam will also contact its
 major customers to confirm their preparations for Year 2000 issues. The Company
 has already responded to numerous customer inquiries and believes that all of
 the Company's major customers have established programs to deal with Year 2000
 issues. In order to improve the Company's
 
                                        36
 <PAGE>
 
 communication with its customers, suppliers and business partners, the Company
 has set up a Sunbeam Year 2000 telephone number and is in the process of
 providing Year 2000 information on a Company web site.
 
          PHASE 4 - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase will involve contingency
 planning for unresolved Year 2000 issues, particularly any issues arising with
 third party suppliers. The Company's Year 2000 readiness program is ongoing and
 its ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, will
 continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. As a
 precautionary measure, Sunbeam plans to establish a contingency plan for
 addressing any effects of the Year 2000 on its operations, whether due to
 Sunbeam's systems or those of third parties not being ready for any Year 2000
 issues. Sunbeam expects to complete such contingency plan by September 30, 1999;
 such contingency plan will address alternative processes, such as manual
 procedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative service providers,
 and plans to address Year 2000 readiness issues as they arise.
 
 THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM'S YEAR 2000 APPROACH
 
          The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year 2000
 readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company's approach, have
 assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest
 single component (upgrade or installation of the Company's uniform system) of
 the Company's Year 2000 program. As a result, although the Company did not
 engage an independent third party to verify the program's overall approach or
 total cost, the Company believes that the Company's exposure in this regard is
 mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnostic tools
 which helped to identify potential Year 2000 issues in one significant business
 operation, the Company believes that it has also mitigated its risk by
 validating and verifying key program components.
 
          Management believes that, although there are significant systems that
 are being modified or replaced, Sunbeam's information systems environment will
 be made Year 2000 ready prior to January 1, 2000. Sunbeam's failure to timely
 complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the
 Company.
 
          With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failure
 of certain of these third parties to become Year 2000 ready could also have a
 material adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of the
 Company's principal suppliers to have Year 2000 ready internal systems could
 impact the Company's ability to manufacture and/or ship its products or to
 maintain adequate inventory levels for production.
 
          At this time, the Company believes that the most likely "worst-case"
 scenario relating to Year 2000 involves potential disruptions in areas in which
 the Company's operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whose
 systems may not work properly after January 1, 2000. While such system failures
 could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Company
 and its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at present
 estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subject
 to the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third parties
 whose operations are not made ready for Year 2000 issues, the impact on
 Sunbeam's operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannot
 be developed prior to January 1, 2000.
 
          The nature and focus of the Company's efforts to address the Year 2000
 problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues
 are identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of the
 Company's efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections
 with respect to activities required in the future. These estimates and
 projections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may be
 substantial.
 
 THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY'S YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
          Through December 31, 1998, Sunbeam had expended approximately $19
 million to address Year 2000 issues of which approximately half was recorded as
 capital expenditures and the remainder as SG&A expense. Sunbeam's current
 assessment of the total costs to address and remedy Year 2000 issues and enhance
 its operating systems, including costs for the acquired companies, is
 approximately $60 million. The amount to be incurred for Year 2000 issues during
 1999 of approximately $41 million represents over 50% of the Company's total
 1999 budget for information systems and related support, including Year 2000
 costs. A large majority of these costs are expected to be incremental
 expenditures that will not recur in the Year 2000 or thereafter. Fees and
 expenses related to third party consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well
 as the modification and replacement of software, represent approximately 75% of
 the total estimated cost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates
 primarily to software license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs
 associated with Company employees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be
 financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A
 significant portion of these expenditures will enhance Sunbeam's operating
 systems in addition to resolving the Year 2000 issues. As Sunbeam completes its
 assessment of the Year 2000 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be
 incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above.
 
                                        37
 <PAGE>
 
          Because Year 2000 readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam has
 redeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year
 2000 issues. In addition, due to the importance of IT systems to the Company's
 business, management has deferred non-critical systems enhancements as much as
 possible. The Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have
 a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or
 cash flows.
 
 EFFECTS OF INFLATION
 
          For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, the
 Company's cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable. To
 the extent possible, the Company's objective is to offset the impact of
 inflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and price
 increases.
