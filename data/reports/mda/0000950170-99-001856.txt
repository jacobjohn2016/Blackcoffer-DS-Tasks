         OF OPERATIONS
 
          The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
 accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
 footnotes included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as the
 consolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management's discussion
 and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company's
 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 1998.
 
 ACQUISITIONS
 
          On March 30, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
 acquired approximately 81% of the total number of then outstanding shares of
 common stock of Coleman from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes ("M&F"), in
 exchange for 14,099,749 shares of the Company's common stock and approximately
 $160 million in cash. In addition, the Company assumed approximately $1,016
 million in debt. Immediately thereafter, as a result of the exercise of Coleman
 employee stock options, Sunbeam's indirect beneficial ownership of Coleman
 decreased to approximately 79% of the total number of the outstanding shares of
 Coleman common stock. The Company's agreement for the acquisition of the
 remaining publicly held Coleman shares pursuant to a merger transaction provides
 that the remaining Coleman shareholders will receive:
 
          o        approximately 6.7 million shares of Sunbeam common stock
                   (0.5677 of a share for each outstanding Coleman share); and,
 
          o        approximately $87 million in cash ($6.44 for each outstanding
                   Coleman share and the cash-out of unexercised Coleman employee
                   stock options for an amount equal to the difference between
                   $27.50 per share and the exercise price of such options).
 
          The Company expects to complete the Coleman merger during the fourth
 quarter of 1999 or early in the first quarter of 2000, although there can be no
 assurance that the merger will occur during that time. See the discussion below
 under the heading "Issuance of Warrants to M&F" for information regarding the
 settlement claims relating to the Coleman acquisition, the terms of which
 provide for the issuance at the time of the merger of warrants to purchase up to
 4.98 million shares of Sunbeam's common stock at $7 per share.
 
          On April 6, 1998, the Company completed the cash acquisitions of First
 Alert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and
 Signature Brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products.
 The First Alert and the Signature Brands acquisitions were valued at
 approximately $182 million (including $133 million of cash and $49 million of
 assumed debt) and approximately $255 million (reflecting cash paid, including
 the required retirement or defeasance of debt), respectively.
 
          The acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting
 and accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of each
 acquired entity are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 from the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices of the acquired
 entities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities
 assumed based on estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisals
 at the dates of acquisition.

          The combined results from operations for the nine months ended
 September 30, 1998 include the combined historical results of Coleman, Signature
 Brands and First Alert from the beginning of 1998 to their respective
 acquisition dates. The combined historical results do not include pro forma
 purchase accounting adjustments including those relating to the amortization of
 the purchase price of these acquisitions. Certain amounts included in the
 historical results of the acquired companies have been reclassified to conform
 to the Company's presentation. Presentation of these combined results is made to
 enhance comparability between the periods presented and such amounts are not
 necessarily indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had
 these acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of 1998.
 
 PROVISION FOR INVENTORY
 
          In the second and third quarters of 1998, the Company recorded charges
 totaling $86.2 million as a result of the following:
 
          o        Inventories were built during 1997 and the first half of 1998
                   in anticipation of 1998 sales volumes which did not
                   materialize. As a result, it has been and will continue to be
                   necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at
                   amounts less than cost. Accordingly, during 1998, when the
                   facts and circumstances were known that such sales volume
                   would not materialize, the Company recorded $48.6 million in
                   charges (of which $46.4 million and $2.2 million were recorded
                   in the second and third quarters, respectively) to properly
                   state this inventory at the lower-of-cost-or-market. This
                   inventory primarily related to certain appliances, grills and
                   grill accessories.
 
          o        A charge of $11.0 million was recorded during the second
                   quarter of 1998 for excess inventories for raw material and
                   work in process that will not be used due to outsourcing the
                   production of breadmakers, toasters, and some other
                   appliances.
 
                                      - 25 -
 <PAGE>
 
          o        In the second quarter of 1998, the Company made the decision
                   to exit certain product lines, primarily air and water
                   filtration products and eliminate some stock keeping units
                   ("SKU's") within existing product lines, primarily relating to
                   appliances, grills and grill accessories. As a result of this
                   decision, a $26.6 million charge was recorded during the
                   second quarter of 1998 to properly state this inventory at the
                   lower-of-cost-or market.
 
          These charges to record excess inventories at the
 lower-of-cost-or-market were based upon management's best estimate of net
 realizable value. (See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
          In addition to the charge taken in 1998, the excess and obsolete
 inventory referenced above has impacted the Company's operating results in
 several ways, with two primary effects. First, gross margins have been impacted
 by sales, at below normal prices, of obsolete inventory into non-traditional
 channels and excess inventory into traditional channels. In addition, due to the
 high levels of excess inventory at the end of 1998, the Company's usage of its
 manufacturing facilities has been lower than normal, resulting in lower fixed
 cost absorption, which in turn, reduced gross margins in 1999.
 
 ASSET IMPAIRMENT
 
          During 1998, management made decisions to outsource or discontinue a
 substantial number of products previously made by the Company (principally
 breadmakers, toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtration
 products and the elimination of some SKU's within existing product lines,
 primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories). As a result,
 some facilities and equipment held by the Company at such time are either no
 longer used or are utilized in a significantly different manner. Accordingly, a
 charge of $29.6 million was recorded in Cost of Goods Sold to write some of
 these assets down to their estimated fair market value. Subsequent to the
 decisions made in conjunction with the acquisitions, management decided to
 discontinue certain SKU's within product lines, principally generators,
 compressors and propane cylinders. As a result, in the third quarter of 1998,
 the Company recorded in Cost of Goods Sold an additional provision for
 impairment of fixed assets of $3.1 million in an acquired entity relating to
 assets taken out of service for which there was no remaining value. These assets
 are expected to be substantially disposed of by December 31, 1999. (See Note 7
 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 PURCHASE ACCOUNTING
 
          The Company recorded the 1998 acquisitions using the purchase method of
 accounting. In accordance with this accounting method, inventory pertaining to
 the acquisitions was recorded at fair value. The fair value of the inventory
 exceeded the book value reflected on the balance sheets of the acquired
 companies as of the respective acquisition dates. The excess of the fair value
 of inventory over its pre-acquisition book value was recorded in cost of sales
 as the inventory was sold. The non-recurring impact of this purchase accounting
 adjustment was $20.5 million and $7.6 million in the second and third quarters
 of 1998, respectively.
 
 ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS TO M&F
 
          On August 12, 1998, the Company announced that, following investigation
 and negotiation conducted by a Special Committee of the Board of Directors
 consisting of four outside directors not affiliated with M&F, the Company had
 entered into a settlement agreement with a subsidiary of M&F pursuant to which
 the Company was released from certain threatened claims of M&F and its
 subsidiaries arising from the Coleman acquisition and M&F agreed to provide
 certain management personnel and assistance to the Company in exchange for the
 issuance to the M&F subsidiary of a warrant expiring August 24, 2003 to purchase
 up to 23 million shares of the Company's common stock at a cash exercise price
 of $7.00 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Company concluded
 that the agreement to issue this warrant did not result in a new measurement
 date for the purposes of determining the purchase price for Coleman and
 accounted for the issuance of this warrant in the third quarter of 1998 as a
 cost of settling a potential claim. Accordingly, a $70.0 million non-cash SG&A
 expense was recorded in the third quarter of 1998, based upon a valuation
 performed as of August 1998 using facts existing at that time. The valuation was
 conducted by an independent consultant engaged by the special committee of the
 board of directors.
 
 FORMER EMPLOYEES' DEFERRED COMPENSATION/SEVERANCE
 
          On February 20, 1998, the Company entered into new three-year
 employment agreements with its then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two
 other senior officers of the Company. The new employment agreements provided
 for, among other items, the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and the
 forfeiture of unvested restricted stock that had
 
                                      - 26 -
 <PAGE>
 
 been granted under the executives' prior employment agreements, new restricted
 stock grants and options to purchase common shares. In addition, the new
 employment agreements provided for income tax gross-ups with respect to any tax
 assessed on the restricted stock grants and acceleration of vesting of
 restricted stock. Total compensation expense recognized in the first quarter of
 1998 related to these items was approximately $31 million. The Company also
 recognized approximately $3.8 million of severance for former employees in the
 third quarter of 1998. (See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
 YEAR 2000 AND SYSTEMS INITIATIVES EXPENSES
 
          See "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure" within this Item II -
 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations".
 
 RESTATEMENT RELATED EXPENSES
 
          On June 30, 1998, the Company announced that the Audit Committee was
 initiating a review into the accuracy of the Company's prior financial
 statements. The Audit Committee's review was completed and, as a result of its
 findings, the Company was required to restate its previously issued consolidated
 financial statements for 1996 and 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. In
 connection with the restatement efforts, the Company incurred $10.8 million of
 costs in the third quarter of 1998 principally representing legal and accounting
 and auditing costs of $6.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively.
 
 OFFICE RELOCATION EXPENSE
 
          In 1998, the Company made the decision to relocate the corporate
 headquarters and exit several existing building leases in connection with a plan
 to consolidate office space. Accordingly, a charge of $4.0 million was recorded
 in the third quarter primarily related to lease termination fees and
 cancellation penalties.
 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
 30, 1998
 
          Consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 1999
 and 1998 were $601.6 million and $496.0 million respectively, an increase of
 $105.6 million or approximately 21%. This increase was driven primarily by the
 Outdoor Leisure group where net sales increased $62.5 million to $221.1 million
 in the third quarter of 1999. This increase was predominately driven by strong
 retail replenishment demand of outdoor recreation products and
 Powermate/registered trademark/ generators (aggregating approximately $58
 million). The increase in outdoor recreation products and Powermate/registered
 trademark/ generators is believed to be partially attributable to heightened
 consumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. This increased
 sensitivity is believed to be reflective of a combination of factors including
 weather conditions and Year 2000 considerations. Outdoor cooking product net
 sales increases in the 1999 period as compared to the third quarter of 1998
 accounted for the balance of the sales increase. The increase in outdoor cooking
 product sales was largely the result of strong retail conditions. Household net
 sales increased $20.7 million to $239.9 million in 1999. After adjusting for the
 Company's estimate of the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter to
 allow trade inventories to return to normal levels, which impacted all segments,
 but which was most significant for the Household segment. Household segment
 sales were essentially flat as compared to the third quarter in 1998. Within the
 Household segment, net sales of personal care and health products increased as a
 result of a strengthening retail environment largely offset by decreases in
 sales of appliances and timing of First Alert product sales. International net
 sales increased $25.3 million to $139.0 million. This increase in net sales was
 largely driven by improved net sales in Canada of approximately $12 million,
 resulting predominantly from strong retail demand for Powermate/registered
 trademark/. Net sales increases in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific, resulting
 primarily from increased sales of outdoor recreation products and reduced levels
 of sales returns, account for the remainder of the increase in International net
 sales.
 
          Gross margin for the third quarter in 1999 was $158.8 million or $91.4
 million higher than the comparable period in 1998. Excluding the effects of 1998
 non-recurring items, as summarized above under "Non-Recurring Charges", gross
 margin was $80.3 million in the third quarter of 1998. As a percentage of net
 sales, gross margin improved to approximately 26% in the third quarter of 1999
 as compared to the third quarter 1998 gross margin of approximately 14% and 1998
 adjusted gross margin of approximately 16%. Three-quarters of the increase in
 gross margin dollars was generated through higher sales volumes, volume-related
 manufacturing fixed cost absorption improvements and improvements in
 manufacturing performance driven by the Outdoor Leisure group which contributed
 over 50% of the
 
                                      - 27 -
 <PAGE>
 
 improvement in total gross margin dollars in the third quarter of 1999.
 Decreases in customer allowances, which are deductions from gross sales to
 arrive at net sales, along with improvements in the product sales mix accounted
 for the remainder of the improvement in gross margin in the third quarter.
 
          SG&A expense in the third quarter of 1999 was $154.5 million,
 representing a 32.4% decrease over the same period in the prior year. Excluding
 the effects of non-recurring items, as summarized above under "Non-Recurring
 Charges", SG&A expense for 1999 was approximately $12 million higher than the
 same period in 1998. The increase in SG&A expense was driven predominantly by
 higher net sales during the quarter and costs related to additional personnel,
 which together account for approximately $20 million. Approximately two-thirds
 of this increase is attributable to higher levels of selling and administrative
 costs primarily in the Outdoor Leisure and International segments driven by
 increased net sales. The remaining increase in SG&A expense is primarily related
 to additional personnel, largely as a result of the Company building staffing
 levels to support future growth, a process that commenced in the third quarter
 of 1998. In addition, SG&A expense in 1999 includes costs associated with
 certain redundant operations resulting from the Company's 1998 acquisitions
 which operations the Company is integrating, as well as the decision to bring
 in-house certain functions that had previously been outsourced. The Company is
 in the process of fully integrating certain of these functions and expects that
 when this process has been completed consolidated SG&A expense for these
 functions will be reduced. Partially offsetting these increases in SG&A expense
 are certain 1998 expenses which did not reoccur in 1999. These 1998 expenses
 include increases associated with restructuring reserve at Coleman
 (approximately $7 million) and higher bad debt expense (approximately $3
 million).
 
          Consolidated operating results for the third quarters of 1999 and 1998,
 were a profit of $4.3 million in 1999 and a loss of $161.0 million in 1998.
 Operating results, as adjusted, were a profit of $9.5 million and a loss of
 $57.4 million in the third quarter of 1999 and 1998, respectively. This change
 resulted from the factors discussed above.
 
          Interest expense, net in the third quarter of 1999 was $48.3 million as
 compared to $42.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Approximately
 40% of this increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowings during the
 third quarter of 1999. The increased level of borrowings was attributable to
 capital expenditures since the third quarter of 1998. The balance of the
 increase was driven by the amortization of the loan commitment fee
 (approximately $1 million) the Company is obligated to pay under the terms of
 the New Credit Facility and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages
 payable to debenture holders (approximately $1 million). See Notes 3 and 10 to
 the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
          Other income, net of $5.2 million for the third quarter of 1999
 included a gain of approximately $4 million relating to the sale of the Mexico
 City facility. This gain was partially offset by losses from other miscellaneous
 asset sales of approximately $1.5 million. The balance of other income, net in
 1999 resulted from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the
 Company's operations in Japan. Other income, net of $11.0 million for the third
 quarter of 1998 included $8.0 million from the settlement of a lawsuit. The
 balance of other income, net in 1999 resulted from favorable foreign exchange
 rates, primarily from Mexico.
 
          The minority interest reported for the third quarter of 1999 and 1998
 relates to the minority interest held in Coleman by public shareholders.
 
          Tax expense recorded in the third quarter of 1999 ($3.7 million)
 related primarily to taxes on foreign income. Income taxes in the third quarter
 of 1998 reflect tax benefits on earnings of foreign operations. No net tax
 benefit was recorded due to the Company's U.S. losses in either year as it is
 management's assessment that the Company cannot demonstrate that it is more
 likely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be
 realized through future taxable income.
 
          On July 12, 1999, the Company acquired 3,000,000 shares of a newly
 created series of Coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price
 of approximately $31 million. These shares, together with the shares of Coleman
 common stock the Company owns, enable Sunbeam to exercise 80.01% of the total
 voting power of Coleman's outstanding capital stock as of July 12, 1999. This
 class of preferred stock was created by Coleman and acquired by the Company in
 order to enable Coleman and the Company to file consolidated federal income tax
 returns, and in certain jurisdictions, consolidated state income tax returns,
 prior to the consummation of the Coleman merger. In connection with the issuance
 of the shares of preferred stock, the Company entered into a tax sharing
 agreement with Coleman, pursuant to which Coleman will pay to Sunbeam amounts
 equal to the federal and state income taxes that would have been payable by
 Coleman had Coleman not been included in the consolidated income tax return of
 the Company. The net proceeds from the issuance of the shares by Coleman of its
 voting preferred stock to the Company were used by Coleman to make a partial

 repayment of loans outstanding from Sunbeam under the Intercompany Note. (See
 Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
          On November 9, 1999, the Company announced a plan to divest Eastpak and
 also plans to divest certain non-essential assets. Proceeds from these assets
 sales are estimated to be $200 million and will be primarily used to pay down
 debt.
 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
 1998
 
          Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 were
 $1,786.4 million and $1,322.1 million respectively, an increase of $464.3
 million. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 include Coleman,
 Signature Brands and First Alert from their respective acquisition dates. After
 adjusting 1998 sales to include sales of the acquired companies for the periods
 from the beginning of 1998 through the respective dates of acquisition, combined
 historical net sales would be $1,624.0 million. 1999 net sales increased
 approximately $162 million or approximately 10% over 1998 combined historical
 net sales. Information that adjusts for the results of the acquisitions prior to
 the actual acquisition dates (the "combined historical" information) is provided
 for informational purposes only and is to enhance comparability of the period
 presented. This information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined
 results would have been had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the
 periods presented or the results for any future period. The increase in net
 sales is driven by the Outdoor Leisure group which had an increase of
 approximately $123 million in 1999 as compared to the combined historical net
 sales in the same period in the prior year. This increase over combined
 historical net sales was largely due to sales of outdoor recreation products and
 Powermate/registered trademark/ generators. The higher level of sales of these
 products is believed to be partially attributable to heightened consumer
 sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. The Company believes that
 this heightened sensitivity is reflective of a combination of factors, including
 weather conditions and Year 2000 considerations. Household net sales in 1999
 increased approximately $11 million compared to 1998 combined historical net
 sales. The Company believes that the decrease in shipments in the prior year in
 order to allow trade inventories to return to a normal level is primarily
 responsible for this increase. This factor affects the year to year comparisons
 for each of the operating groups. Adjusting for the effect on 1998 of loading,
 the Company believes that Household net sales in 1999 were approximately the
 same as in the prior year. Within the Household segment, net sales of personal
 care products increased as a result of a strengthening retail environment
 largely offset by decreases in sales of appliances. International net sales in
 1999 increased $30.3 million over 1998 combined historical net sales. Higher
 sales in Canada, Europe and Japan resulted predominantly from strong retail
 demand of Powermate/registered trademark/ and outdoor recreation products. This
 increase was partially offset by the impact of weak economic conditions in Latin
 America.
 
          Gross margin for the first nine months of 1999 was $452.3 million or
 $403.6 million higher than the comparable period in 1998. Adjusting for the
 combined results of the acquired companies and excluding the effects of 1998
 non-recurring items, which are summarized above under the heading "Non-Recurring
 Charges", gross margin for the first nine months of 1999 increased approximately
 $182 million over the 1998 combined historical gross margin. As a percentage of
 net sales, gross margin improved to approximately 25% in the first nine months
 of 1999 as compared to approximately 4% in the 1998 period. The gross margin
 percentage for the 1998 period adjusted for the non-recurring charges and for
 the effect of the acquired companies was approximately 17% of combined
 historical net sales. The Household group contributed approximately 30% of the
 1999 gross margin improvement over the 1998 combined historical gross margin.
 The improvement in the Household group's gross margin resulted primarily from
 lower sales deduction rates, improved manufacturing processes and controls,
 additional sales volume, and improved product mix. The Outdoor Leisure group
 contributed approximately 50% of the 1999 gross margin improvement over the 1998
 combined historical gross margin. Approximately 80% of the improvement in the
 Outdoor Leisure group's gross margin resulted from additional volume and related
 improved manufacturing overhead absorption, as well as improvements in
 manufacturing. The balance of the increase resulted from improved product mix.
 The International group contributed approximately 20% of the 1999 gross margin
 improvement over 1998 combined historical gross margin. Approximately 40% of the
 improvement in the International group's gross margin resulted from the shut
 down of the Mexico City manufacturing facility which had experienced high
 material usage costs and employee benefit costs in the prior year. The remaining
 improvement resulted from increased sales volume, a lower level of product
 returns and improved product mix.
 
          SG&A expense for the first nine months of 1999 was $449.3 million, an
 increase of $8.9 million or 2.0% over the same period in the prior year. After
 adjusting 1998 SG&A expense to include the acquired companies' SG&A expense for
 the period from the beginning of 1998 through the respective dates of
 acquisition ($100.9 million), combined historical
 
                                      - 29 -
 <PAGE>
 
 SG&A expense was $541.3 million. Since the combined historical 1998 SG&A
 expenses were derived by adding the acquired companies' pre-acquisition period
 costs to the reported nine months' results of Sunbeam, the combined historical
 SG&A expenses include $30.4 million of amortization of intangibles expense
 representing both pre- and post-acquisition periods, as well as approximately
 $12 million of transaction costs incurred by the acquired companies relating to
 them being purchased by Sunbeam. Excluding these costs and the effects of 1998
 non-recurring charges, as described above under "Non-Recurring Charges",
 adjusted 1998 SG&A expenses were approximately $378 million. Excluding
 amortization of intangibles expense of $38.4 million for the first nine months
 of 1999 and the non-recurring charges, as described above under "Non-Recurring
 Charges", adjusted 1999 SG&A costs were $392.2 million, an increase of
 approximately $14 million over adjusted 1998 SG&A expense. As previously
 discussed, this increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of selling
 and administrative costs driven by increased net sales, headcount increases to
 support future growth and costs associated with certain redundant operations
 resulting from the Company's 1998 acquisitions which operations the Company is
 integrating and the decision to bring in-house certain functions that had
 previously been outsourced. The Company is in the process of fully integrating
 certain of these functions and expects that when this process has been completed
 consolidated SG&A expense for these functions will be reduced. Partially
 offsetting these increases in SG&A expense are certain 1998 expenses which did
 not reoccur in 1999. These 1998 expenses include increases associated with
 restructuring reserve at Coleman (approximately $7 million) and higher bad debt
 expense (approximately $5 million).
 
          Operating results for the first nine months of 1999 and 1998, were a
 profit of $3.0 million in 1999 and a loss of $391.7 million in 1998. Adjusted
 for the historical results of the acquired companies and excluding non-recurring
 charges, as previously described, operating results for the 1999 and 1998
 periods were a profit of $21.7 million and a loss of $149.2 million,
 respectively. This change resulted from the factors discussed above.
 
          Interest expense increased from $88.5 million in 1998 to $136.6 million
 in 1999. Approximately 75% of the change related to higher borrowing levels in
 1999 resulting primarily from borrowings for the acquisitions that were
 outstanding for the entire 1999 nine month period as compared to only a portion
 of the 1998 period. The balance of this increase was primarily driven by the
 amortization of the loan commitment fee (approximately $2 million) the Company
 is obligated to pay under the terms of the New Credit Facility and the expense
 related to liquidated damages payable to debenture holders (approximately $3
 million).
 
          Other income, net of $4.6 million in 1999 included a gain of
 approximately $4 million relating to the sale of the Mexico City facility. This
 gain was partially offset by losses from other miscellaneous asset sales of
 approximately $0.3 million. The remaining other income, net in 1999 resulted
 from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the Company's operations
 in Japan. Other income, net of $4.1 million in 1998 included $8.0 million from
 the settlement of a lawsuit partially offset by net foreign exchange losses,
 primarily from Mexico.
 
          The minority interest reported in 1999 and 1998 relates to the minority
 interest held in Coleman by public shareholders.
 
          Approximately $6 million of the $12.7 million income tax expense
 recorded in 1999 related to U.S. tax liability generated by Coleman as a
 separate U.S. tax filing entity. As previously discussed, in July 1999, the
 Company acquired a sufficient ownership interest in Coleman to permit it to file
 consolidated U.S. tax returns with Coleman for all future periods. The remaining
 tax expense recorded in 1999 related to taxes on foreign income and was
 partially offset by the favorable resolution of an income tax audit. Tax expense
 recorded in 1998 was nearly all related to foreign taxes. No net tax benefit was
 recorded on the Company's losses in either year as it is management's assessment
 that the Company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that
 deferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through future
 taxable income.
 
          In March 1998, the Company prepaid a $75.0 million 7.85% industrial
 revenue bond related to its Hattiesburg facility originally due in 2009. In
 connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the Company recognized an
 extraordinary charge in the first quarter of 1998. As a result of repayment of
 certain indebtedness assumed in the Coleman acquisition, the Company also
 recognized an extraordinary charge in the second quarter of 1998. The debt
 assumed in connection with the Coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of the
 requirements under the terms of the New Credit Facility. These extraordinary
 charges consisted of redemption premiums ($106.9 million), unamortized debt
 discount ($13.8 million) and unamortized deferred financing costs ($1.7 million)
 and were net of income taxes ($10.7 million).

 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
          Approximately 75% of the Company's business is conducted in U.S.
 dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export sales,
 primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority of
 European sales). The Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made
 principally by subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, Japan, Latin America and Mexico.
 Mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997;
 therefore, translation adjustments related to Mexican net monetary assets were
 included as a component of net (loss) earnings. Mexico is not considered
 hyperinflationary as of January 1, 1999. This change in Mexico's
 hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the
 Company's financial results. Translation adjustments resulting from the
 Company's non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries have not had a material
 impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash
 flows.
 
          While revenues generated in Asia have traditionally not been
 significant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative
 effect on earnings. Economic instability and the political environment in Latin
 America have also affected sales in that region. It is anticipated that sales in
 and exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as the
 economic environments in those regions remain unsettled.
 
          On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures that
 arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are entered into
 for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives has not had a
 material impact on the Company's financial results.
 
 SEASONALITY
 
          Sunbeam's consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial
 seasonality; however, sales are expected to be strongest during the second
 quarter of the calendar year. Furthermore, sales of a number of products,
 including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, First Alert
 products, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weather
 conditions.
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 DEBT INSTRUMENTS
 
          In order to finance the acquisition of Coleman, First Alert and
 Signature Brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the
 Company and the three acquired companies, the Company consummated an offering in
 March 1998 of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of 5%, which
 resulted in approximately $730 million of net proceeds and borrowed about $1,325
 million under its new bank credit facility.
 
          The debentures are exchangeable for shares of the Company 's common
 stock at an initial conversion rate of 6.575 shares for each $1,000 principal
 amount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence of
 specified events. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all
 existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The debentures are not
 redeemable by the Company prior to March 25, 2003. On or after such date, the
 debentures are redeemable for cash with at least 30 days notice, at the option
 of the Company. The Company is required to purchase debentures at the option of
 the holder as of March 25, 2003, March 25, 2008 and March 25, 2013, at purchase
 prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates.
 Sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or
 common stock or any combination thereof. However, the bank credit facility
 prohibits the Company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. The
 Company was required to file a registration statement with the SEC to register
 the debentures by June 23, 1998. This registration statement was filed on
 February 4, 1999 and, as amended, was declared effective on November 8, 1999.
 The Company 's failure to file the registration statement by June 23, 1998 did
 not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. From June 23, 1998
 until the registration statement was declared effective, the Company was
 required to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, for
 each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% during the first
 90 days and 0.50% thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the
 debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. The Company has
 made total payments for liquidated damages since June 23, 1998 of $4.5 million,
 of which $1.5 million related to damages for the period through December 31,
 1998. A final payment of approximately $0.5 million, representing liquidated
 damages from September 26, 1999 until the registration statement was declared
 effective, will be payable on March 25, 2000.

          Concurrent with the acquisitions, the Company replaced its $250 million
 syndicated unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with the bank credit
 facility. The bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to
 $1.7 billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the Company
 to maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge
 coverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after March 31,
 1998 and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of the
 borrowings under the bank credit facility.
 
          As a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurred
 during the first half of 1998, the Company did not achieve the specified
 financial ratios for June 30, 1998 and it appeared unlikely that the Company
 would achieve the specified financial ratios for September 30, 1998.
 Consequently, the Company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as of
 June 30, 1998 that waived through December 31, 1998 all defaults arising from
 the failure of the Company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for June
 30, 1998 and September 30, 1998. Pursuant to an agreement with the Company dated
 as of October 19, 1998, the Company 's lenders extended all of the waivers under
 the June 30 agreement through April 10, 1999 and also waived through such date
 all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy the specified
 financial ratios for December 31, 1998. As part of the October 19, 1998
 agreement, the Company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings before interest,
 taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") covenant (as defined in the bank
 credit facility) which covenant the Company has been able to satisfy.
 
          On April 10, 1999, among other things, the lenders extended all of the
 waivers set forth in the October 19, 1998 agreement through April 15, 1999. On
 April 15, 1999, the Company and its lenders entered into a comprehensive
 amendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all of
 the waivers under the April 10, 1999 agreement until April 10, 2000 and waived
 until such date all defaults arising from any failure by the Company to satisfy
 the specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during 1999
 and for March 31, 2000.
 
          As part of the April 15, 1999 bank credit facility amendment, the
 Company agreed to a minimum cumulative EBITDA covenant that is based on
 post-December 31, 1998 consolidated EBITDA and is tested at the end of each
 month occurring on or prior to March 31, 2000, as well as a covenant limiting
 the amount of revolving loans (other than those used to fund the Coleman merger)
 that may be outstanding under the bank credit facility as of the end of each
 such month. The minimum cumulative EBITDA was initially $6.3 million for the
 period January 1, 1999 through April 30, 1999 and generally grows on a monthly
 basis until it reaches $121.0 million for the period from January 1, 1999
 through March 31, 2000. Following is a description of the significant terms of
 the bank credit facility as amended April 15, 1999.
 
 The bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $1.7 billion
 through:
 
          o        a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount
                   of up to $400.0 million maturing March 30, 2005, $52.5 million
                   of which may only be used to complete the Coleman merger;
 
          o        up to $800.0 million in term loans maturing on March 30, 2005,
                   of which $35.0 million may only be used to complete the
                   Coleman merger; and
 
          o        a $500.0 million term loan maturing September 30, 2006, of
                   which $5.0 million has already been repaid through September
                   30, 1999.
 
          As of September 30, 1999, approximately $1.5 billion was outstanding
 and approximately $0.2 billion was available for borrowing under the bank credit
 facility.
 
 Under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the Company 's option:
 
          o        at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR");
 
          o        or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is
                   generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of
                   the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%;
 
 in each case plus an interest margin which is currently 4.00% for LIBOR
 borrowings and 2.50% for base rate borrowings. The applicable interest margin is
 subject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events including
 a 1.00% decrease for LIBOR borrowings and a 0.75% decrease for base rate
 borrowings concurrent with the effective date of the Coleman merger.
 
                                      - 32 -
 <PAGE>
 
          Under the terms of the April 15, 1999 amendment to the bank credit
 facility, the Company is obligated to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment fee
 of between 0.25% to 1.00% of the commitments under the bank credit facility as
 of April 15, 1999. The percentage used to calculate the fee will be determined
 by reference to the bank lenders' aggregate commitments and loan exposure under
 the bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before September 30, 2000.
 The fee is payable on the earlier of September 30, 2000 and the date the
 commitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bank
 credit facility are repaid. (See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.)
 
          Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge of
 the stock of the Company's material subsidiaries, including Coleman, and by a
 security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
 material domestic subsidiaries, other than Coleman and its material subsidiaries
 except as described below. Currently, Coleman's inventory and related assets are
 pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account
 under the bank credit facility. Additionally, as security for Coleman's note
 payable to the Company, Coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic
 assets, other than real property, including 66% of the stock of its direct
 foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiaries
 and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not the
 assets of Coleman's subsidiaries. The pledge runs in favor of the Company 's
 lending banks, to which the Coleman note has been pledged as security for the
 Company 's obligations to them. Upon completion of the Coleman merger,
 substantially all of Coleman's assets and the assets of Coleman's domestic
 subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank credit
 facility.
 
          In addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteed
 by a number of the Company 's wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and
 these subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. Upon completion of
 the Coleman merger, Coleman and each of its United States subsidiaries will
 become guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. To the
 extent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the Company, the
 obligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company.
 
          In addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bank
 credit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similar
 nature, including limitations on the ability of the Company and its
 subsidiaries, including Coleman, to, among other things:
 
          o        declare dividends or repurchase stock;
          o        prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in
                   sale-leaseback transactions;
          o        make loans and investments;
          o        incur additional debt (including revolving loans under the
                   bank credit facility);
          o        amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into
                   restrictive agreements;
          o        make capital and Year 2000 compliance expenditures;
          o        engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;
          o        engage in transactions with specified affiliates;
          o        settle specified litigation;
          o        alter its cash management system; and
          o        alter the businesses they conduct.
 
 Sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants and
 ratios.
 
          The bank credit facility provides for events of default customary for
 transactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of
 covenant, cross-defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising from
 compliance with ERISA, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees and
 change of ownership and control. It is also an event of default under the bank
 credit facility, as amended November 16, 1999, if the Company 's registration
 statement in connection with the Coleman merger is not declared effective by the
 SEC on or before January 10, 2000, or if the merger does not occur within 25
 business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash
 consideration--including any payments on account of the exercise of any
 appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customary
 fees and expenses--to consummate the Coleman merger exceeds $87.5 million.
 Although there can be no assurance, the Company anticipates that it will satisfy
 these conditions. Furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the Company to
 prepay term loans under the bank credit facility on December 31, 1999 to the
 extent that cash on hand in the Company 's concentration accounts plus the
 aggregate amount of unused revolving loan commitments
 
                                      - 33 -
 <PAGE>
 
 on this date exceeds $125 million, but the Company is not required to prepay
 more than $69.3 million in the aggregate as a result of this provision.
 
          Unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the Company to
 satisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank credit
 facility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank credit
 facility would entitle the bank lenders to (a) receive a 2.00% increase in the
 interest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter of
 credit fees to 1.00% and (b) accelerate the maturity of the outstanding
 borrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their other
 rights and remedies. Any such acceleration or other exercise of rights and
 remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
          The bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral of
 the September 30, 1999 and the March 31, 2000 scheduled term loan payments of
 $69.3 million each until April 10, 2000 as a result of the satisfaction by the
 Company of the agreed upon conditions to the deferral. (See Note 3 to the
 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)
 
 CASH FLOWS
 
          As of September 30, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
 $29.1 million and total debt of $2.3 billion. Because the waivers granted by the
 Company's lenders expire on April 10, 2000, the borrowings under the bank credit
 facility, as well as other debt containing cross-default provisions, are
 classified as current in the September 30, 1999 Condensed Consolidated Balance
 Sheet. Cash used in operating activities during the first nine months of 1999
 was $73.2 million compared to $224.7 million in the first nine months of 1998.
 This change is primarily attributable to improved operating results after giving
 effect to non-cash items, partially offset by increased working capital needs
 during the 1999 period. The increase in cash used for working capital during the
 1999 period was primarily driven by accounts receivable, which increased $159.4
 million as compared to the 1998 period, primarily attributable to the Company's
 Outdoor Leisure division which experienced stronger second and third quarters
 sales in 1999 than in 1998. Additionally, working capital for the 1998 period
 was positively affected by the timing of the Company's acquisition of Coleman,
 which was at the peak of its inventory build for the 1998 selling season. Cash
 used for this acquired inventory is not reflected in working capital for the
 1998 period. As a result of the effect of Company's management of inventory
 levels in 1999, cash flow improved approximately $81 million as compared to 1998
 despite the favorable impact of the inventory acquired in connection with the
 1998 acquisitions. Increases in accounts payable of approximately $30 million in
 the first nine months of 1999 positively impacted cash flow whereas payables
 used approximately $76 million of cash in the same period of 1998, resulting in
 an improvement in cash flow period-to-period of approximately $106 million. The
 increase in payables in the current period resulted from payable balances having
 been reduced to a low level by year-end 1998. This reduction in payables, which
 included an effort to reduce delinquent payables, began in the second quarter of
 1998. Decreases in other liabilities, primarily accrued interest, account for
 the majority of the balance of the cash used for working capital in 1999. The
 Company participates in an accounts receivable securitization program to finance
 a portion of its accounts receivable. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated
 Financial Statements.
 
          In the first nine months of 1999, cash used in investing activities was
 driven by capital expenditures of $63.2 million, primarily for information
 systems, including expenditures for Year 2000 readiness and equipment and
 tooling for new products. Capital spending in the comparable 1998 period was
 $32.8 million and was primarily for several manufacturing efficiency
 initiatives, equipment and tooling for new products and management information
 systems and software licenses. The new product capital spending in the 1998
 period principally related to the appliance category and included costs related
 to water and air filtration products which were discontinued in the second
 quarter, blenders, standmixers and irons. Cash used in investing activities in
 the first nine months of 1998 also reflects $379.2 million for the acquisitions
 of the shares of Coleman from a subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, as well as
 the acquisitions of Signature Brands and First Alert. The Company anticipates
 1999 capital spending to be less than 5% of net sales. Capital expenditures in
 the current year are expected to primarily relate to information systems and
 related support, including expenditures for Year 2000 readiness, new product
 introductions and capacity additions.
 
          Cash provided by financing activities totaled $99.2 million in the
 first nine months of 1999 and reflected net borrowings under the Company's bank
 credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months
 of 1998 was $636.1 million and reflected net proceeds from the debentures of
 $729.6 million, the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under
 the Company's $250 million September 1996 revolving credit facility, the
 repayment of certain debt assumed in connection with the Coleman, Signature
 Brands and First Alert acquisitions, and the early extinguishment of the $75.0
 million Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond. In addition, cash provided by
 financing

 activities in 1998 is net of $26.2 million of financing fees related to
 Sunbeam's $1.7 billion bank credit facility and $19.6 million of proceeds from
 the exercise of stock options. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated
 Financial Statements.
 
          At September 30, 1999, standby and commercial letters of credit
 aggregated $68.9 million and were predominately for insurance, pension,
 environmental, workers' compensation, and international trade activities. In
 addition, as of September 30, 1999, surety bonds with a contract value of $67.5
 million were outstanding largely for the Company's pension plans and as a result
 of litigation judgments that are currently under appeal.
 
          The Company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in Coleman
 in a merger transaction in which the existing Coleman minority shareholders will
 receive 0.5677 of a share of the Company's common stock and $6.44 in cash for
 each share of Coleman common stock outstanding. In addition, unexercised options
 under Coleman's stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equal
 to the difference between $27.50 and the exercise price of such options. The
 Company expects to issue approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and
 expend approximately $87 million in cash, including cash paid to option holders,
 to complete the Coleman transaction. Under a settlement of certain litigation
 relating to the Coleman merger, the Company will also issue warrants to purchase
 up to 4.98 million shares of the Company's common stock to the Coleman public
 shareholders and the plaintiff's litigation counsel upon consummation of the
 Coleman merger. (See Notes 2 and 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.) Although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated that the
 Coleman merger will occur in the fourth quarter of 1999 or early in the first
 quarter of 2000.
 
          The Company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank credit
 facility, cash flow from the combined operations of the Company and its acquired
 companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable
 securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs,
 capital expenditure and Year 2000 compliance spending, and debt service through
 April 10, 2000. The Company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an
 amendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on further
 waiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility.
 Any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be
 made based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particular
 transactions. There can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of
 existing covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by April
 10, 2000. The failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt
 refinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants and
 non-compliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to
 accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit
 facility, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 Accordingly, debt related to the bank credit facility and all debt containing
 cross-default provisions is classified as current in the September 30, 1999
 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
          In May, 1998, the NYSE advised the Company that it did not meet the
 continuing listing standards of the NYSE because the Company did not have
 tangible net assets of at least $12 million and average annual net income of at
 least $600,000 for 1995, 1996 and 1997. Representatives from the Company met
 with NYSE officials, and in March 1999, the NYSE informed the Company that the
 Company's common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the NYSE
 would, however, continue to monitor Sunbeam's financial condition and
 operations. On August 5, 1999, the NYSE advised the Company that the NYSE had
 revised its continuing listing standards, and that the Company is in compliance
 with the revised standards.
 
          In April, 1999 the NYSE advised Coleman that it did not meet the NYSE's
 continuing listing standards because Coleman did not have tangible net assets of
 at least $12 million and average annual net income of at least $600,000 for
 1995, 1996 and 1997. At that time, Coleman requested the NYSE to continue to
 list the Coleman common stock until completion of the merger. The NYSE
 subsequently advised Coleman that Coleman also failed to satisfy certain
 non-financial continuing listing standards. On August 5, 1999, the NYSE advised
 the Company that the NYSE had revised its continuing listing standards, and that
 the Company is in compliance with the revised financial standards. Coleman and
 the NYSE have agreed upon a program whereby Coleman will correct the
 deficiencies in its non-financial continuing listing standards by the end of
 1999. Coleman is currently complying with such program. If Coleman were to be
 delisted from the NYSE, it would adversely affect Coleman's ability to sell its
 capital stock to third parties or use its capital stock as collateral for loans.
 Sunbeam's bank credit facility currently restricts Coleman from taking such
 actions.
 
          By letter dated June 17, 1998, the staff of the Division of Enforcement
 of the SEC advised the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry into
 the Company 's accounting policies and procedures and requested that the Company
 produce documents. On July 2, 1998, the SEC issued a Formal Order of Private
 Investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which a
 subpoena was served on Sunbeam requiring the production of
 
                                      - 35 -
 <PAGE>
 
 documents. On November 4, 1998, the Company received another SEC subpoena
 requiring the production of additional documents. The Company has provided
 numerous documents to the SEC staff and continues to cooperate with the SEC
 staff. The Company has, however, declined to provide the SEC with material that
 the Company believes is subject to the attorney-client privilege and the work
 product immunity. The Company cannot predict the duration of such investigation
 or its outcome.
 
          The Company is involved in significant litigation, including class and
 derivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of its
 consolidated financial statements, the issuance of the MacAndrews & Forbes
 warrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of Messrs.
 Dunlap and Kersh. Sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, but
 cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihood
 of the Company 's success in each case or the range of potential loss. However,
 if the Company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a material
 adverse effect on the Company 's financial position, results of operations and
 cash flows. Additionally, the Company's insurance carriers have filed various
 suits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors' and officers'
 liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid and/or had been
 properly canceled by the carriers or have advised Sunbeam of their intent to
 deny coverage under such policies. The Company intends to pursue recovery from
 all of its insurers if damages are awarded against the Company or its
 indemnified officers and/or directors under any of the foregoing actions and to
 recover attorneys' fees covered under those policies. The Company 's failure to
 obtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against the
 Company on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on
 the Company 's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
          Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs
 (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation and
 claims and related anticipated legal fees. The costs are accrued when it is both
 probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
 the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company
 's assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on the
 facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of
 the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information
 about the plaintiff, and other significant factors which vary by case. When it
 is not possible to estimate a specific expected amount of loss to be incurred,
 the Company evaluates the range of possible losses and records the minimum end
 of the range. As of September 30, 1999 the Company had established accruals for
 litigation matters of $22.6 million (representing $11.3 million and $11.3
 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees,
 respectively) and $31.2 million as of December 31, 1998 (representing $17.5
 million and $13.7 million for estimated damages or settlements and legal fees,
 respectively.) It is anticipated that the $22.6 million accrual will be paid as
 follows: $5.2 million in 1999, $14.9 million in 2000 and $2.5 million in 2001.
 The Company believes, based on information known to the Company on September 30,
 1999, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as of
 September 30, 1999 have been adequately reserved, to the extent determinable.
 
          As a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the
 constant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for
 substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated
 rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. These claims could result
 in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the product
 lines the Company acquired in the 1998 acquisitions have increased its exposure
 to product liability and related claims.
 
          The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuits
 from time to time that Sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigation
 incidental to its business. In the opinion of the Company, the resolution of
 these routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individually
 or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
 position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
 
          See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
          Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position
 98-1, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR
 INTERNAL USE ("SOP 98-1"). SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated
 with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain
 capitalization criteria are met. Adoption of this statement did not have a
 material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
 operations, or cash flows.

          In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
 of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), ACCOUNTING FOR
 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which, as amended, is effective
 for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires the
 recognition of all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either
 assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The Company has not yet determined
 the impact SFAS No. 133 will have on its consolidated financial position,
 results of operations, or cash flows.
 
 YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
 
          The Company is preparing for the impact of the Year 2000 on its
 operations. Year 2000 issues could include potential problems in the information
 technology ("IT") and non-IT systems that the Company uses in its operations and
 problems in the Company's products. Year 2000 system failures could affect
 routine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production,
 order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. In
 addition, system failures could affect the Company's security, payroll
 operations, or employee safety. The Company may also be exposed to potential
 risks from third parties with whom the Company interacts who fail to adequately
 address their own Year 2000 issues.
 
 SUNBEAM'S APPROACH TO YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
          While the Company's Year 2000 readiness planning had been underway for
 over one year, during the third quarter of 1998 the Company established a
 cross-functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by three
 external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and
 to assist the Company in implementing its Year 2000 strategy. This team is
 sponsored by the Company's Chief Financial Officer who reports directly to the
 Company's Chief Executive Officer on this issue. The audit committee of the
 board of directors is advised periodically on the status of the Company's Year
 2000 readiness program.
 
          The Year 2000 project team has developed a phased approach to identify
 and resolve Year 2000 issues with many of these activities conducted in
 parallel. The Company's approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are
 described below.
 
          PHASE 1 - INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT: During the first phase of Sunbeam's
 Year 2000 readiness program, the Company established a Year 2000 program
 management office ("PMO") to centralize the management of all of the Company's
 Year 2000 projects. Through this office, the Company developed a corporate-wide,
 uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the Year 2000 issues.
 
          The Company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software
 systems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange,
 telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to Year 2000
 problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning,
 ventilation and facility access. This inventory was then entered into the
 Company's Year 2000 database along with a determination of the item's level of
 criticality to operations. For those inventory items anticipated to have a
 significant effect on the business if not corrected, the Company's Year 2000
 program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. All
 information relative to each item is being tracked in the Company's Year 2000
 database. The Company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth
 quarters of 1998. The Company has completed a review of the readiness of
 embedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the
 Company's products have Year 2000 date sensitive systems.
 
          PHASE 2 - CORRECTION AND TESTING: The second phase of Sunbeam's Year
 2000 readiness program was structured to replace, upgrade or remediate (as
 necessary) those items identified during Phase 1 as requiring corrective action.
 
          Sunbeam relies on its IT functions to perform many tasks that are
 critical to its operations. Significant transactions that could be impacted by
 not being ready for any Year 2000 issues include, among others, purchases of
 materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, payroll
 processing and billings and collections. Systems and applications that had been
 identified by Sunbeam as not Year 2000 ready and which are critical to Sunbeam's
 operations include its financial software systems, which process the order
 entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable,
 and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applications
 in the Company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehouse
 management applications. Recognizing how dependent the entire company is on IT,
 Sunbeam decided in 1997 to replace its primary business applications with a
 uniform international business and accounting information system to address the
 systems or applications listed above as well as to improve internal reporting
 processes. Based upon representations from the manufacturer that the current
 
                                      - 37 -
 <PAGE>
 
 version of this uniform information system is Year 2000 ready, the Company
 upgraded its business sites that currently utilize this uniform system to the
 Year 2000 ready version. In addition to the pre-acquisition Sunbeam locations
 which had already utilized an earlier non-Year 2000 ready version of this
 uniform business and accounting information system, Eastpak, Mr. Coffee,
 Health-o-Meter and Sunbeam Latin America replaced their non-Year 2000 ready
 systems with this new uniform system. In addition, Coleman Europe has also
 replaced key business components with this new system.
 
          The Company is also actively replacing and/or upgrading a number of
 business systems that are not Year 2000 ready, including those that use
 localized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by
 the uniform business and accounting information system. For example, at Coleman
 approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs that are used in lieu of
 Sunbeam's uniform business and accounting information system have been
 remediated and tested to be Year 2000 ready. With respect to the Company's
 non-IT systems (for example, time and attendance, security, and in-line
 manufacturing hardware) the Company has analyzed these items to assess any Year
 2000 issues and is testing and correcting such times, if necessary.
 
          PHASE 3 - CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS: The third phase
 of Sunbeam's Year 2000 readiness program which was initiated during the third
 and fourth quarters of 1998 is designed to assess and interact with the
 Company's customers, suppliers, and business partners. As part of this effort,
 the Company surveyed 1,100 vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did not
 provide an initial response. During the first half of 1999, "high risk" vendors
 were contacted directly and the number of non-respondents has since decreased
 substantially. In fact, currently only 7% of the Company's vendors who were
 surveyed are categorized as "high risk" which includes non-respondents. Based on
 the most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the Company
 believes that there is only a low to a medium risk of Year 2000 issues for the
 remaining vendors. The Company will continue to monitor the Year 2000 progress
 of the "high risk" vendors and has re-surveyed these companies to determine the
 appropriate course of action. Furthermore, the Company has contacted alternate
 vendors who are Year 2000 ready to replace critical vendors deemed "high risk"
 in the event that these vendors are not found to be Year 2000 ready. The Company
 is in the process of completing a verification of the Year 2000 survey responses
 for the most critical vendors to the Company.
 
          Sunbeam has responded to numerous customer inquiries about the
 Company's Year 2000 readiness. The Company has verified that all of the
 Company's major customers have planned programs to deal with Year 2000 issues
 and is currently completing the process of contacting its major customers to
 confirm they are implementing their planned programs to address Year 2000
 issues. In order to improve the Company's communication with its customers,
 suppliers and business partners, the Company has set up a Sunbeam Year 2000
 telephone number and is providing Year 2000 information on a Company web site.
 
          PHASE 4 - CONTINGENCY PLANNING: This phase involves contingency
 planning for unresolved Year 2000 issues, particularly any issues arising with
 third party suppliers. The Company has designed and documented its Year 2000
 contingency plan and is in the process of implementing it. The development of
 the contingency plan included a process whereby the Company's critical IT and
 non-IT systems were evaluated for Year 2000 readiness. As a result of this
 evaluation, the Company does not expect to require additional operational
 equipment or significant process contingency measures. Although the Company does
 not currently believe there is significant risk associated with its third party
 suppliers, the contingency plan includes the continuing evaluation of the
 readiness of the Company's suppliers and minor increases in the Company's
 inventory requirements to protect against supply disruption.
 
 THE RISKS OF SUNBEAM'S YEAR 2000 APPROACH
 
          The independent consultants assisting the Company in its Year 2000
 readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the Company's approach, have
 assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest
 single component (upgrade or installation of the Company's uniform system) of
 the Company's Year 2000 program. Since Sunbeam's Year 2000 program was developed
 and is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the Company did not
 engage another independent third party to verify the program's overall approach
 or total cost as the Company believes that the Company's exposure in this regard
 is mitigated. In addition, through the use of external third-party diagnostic
 software packages that are designed to analyze the Year 2000 readiness of
 business software programs, the Company was able to identify potential Year 2000
 issues at Coleman. Given this, the Company believes that it has also mitigated
 its risk by validating and verifying key program components.
 
          Management believes that, although there are significant systems that
 are being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accounting
 information system, Sunbeam's information systems environment will be made Year
 
                                      - 38 -
 <PAGE>
 
 2000 ready prior to January 1, 2000. Sunbeam's failure to timely complete such
 corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 
          With respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failure
 of certain of these third parties to become Year 2000 ready could also have a
 material adverse impact on Sunbeam. For example, the failure of certain of the
 Company's principal suppliers to have Year 2000 ready internal systems could
 impact the Company's ability to manufacture and/or ship its products or to
 maintain adequate inventory levels for production.
 
          At this time, the Company believes that the most likely "worst-case"
 scenario relating to Year 2000 involves potential disruptions in areas in which
 the Company's operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whose
 systems may not work properly after January 1, 2000. While such system failures
 could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the Company
 and its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the Company cannot at present
 estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. Subject
 to the nature of the goods or services provided to the Company by third parties
 whose operations are not made ready for Year 2000 issues, the potential impact
 on Sunbeam's operations could be material. However, the Company believes that it
 has mitigated such risks through the development and implementation of the
 contingency plans discussed above.
 
          The nature and focus of the Company's efforts to address the Year 2000
 problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues
 are identified. In addition, it is important to note that the description of the
 Company's efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections
 with respect to activities required in the future. These estimates and
 projections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may be
 substantial.
 
 THE COSTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPANY'S YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
          Through the first nine months of 1999, including costs incurred in
 1998, Sunbeam had expended approximately $60 million to address Year 2000 issues
 of which approximately 50% was recorded as capital expenditures and the
 remainder as SG&A expense. Sunbeam's current assessment of the total costs to
 address and remedy Year 2000 issues and enhance its operating systems, including
 costs for the acquired companies, is approximately $64 million. This estimate
 includes the following categories:
 
 o    uniform international business and accounting systems          $44 million
 o    localized business system software upgrades and remediation    $ 9 million
 o    Year 2000 readiness assessment and tracking                    $ 6 million
 o    upgrade of personal computers and related software             $ 5 million
 
          The amount to be incurred for Year 2000 issues during 1999 of
 approximately $44 million represents over 50% of the Company's total 1999 budget
 for information systems and related support, including Year 2000 costs. A large
 majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that will
 not recur in the Year 2000 or thereafter. Fees and expenses related to third
 party consultants, who are involved in the PMO as well as the modification and
 replacement of software, represent approximately 75% of the total estimated
 cost. The balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to software
 license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with Company
 employees. Sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operating
 cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. A significant portion of these
 expenditures will enhance Sunbeam's operating systems in addition to resolving
 the Year 2000 issues. As Sunbeam completes its assessment of the Year 2000
 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially
 from the amounts shown above. The bank credit facility does not permit the
 Company to spend more than $50 million on Year 2000 testing and remediation in
 1999.
 
          Because Year 2000 readiness is critical to the business, Sunbeam has
 redeployed some resources from non-critical system enhancements to address Year
 2000 issues, thereby deferring the non-critical systems enhancements. The
 Company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a material
 impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash
 flows.
