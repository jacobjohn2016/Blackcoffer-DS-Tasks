         OF OPERATION
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996
 
 
      In November 1996, the Company initiated a major restructuring and growth
 plan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the business
 in order to restore higher levels of profitability for the Company. By July
 1997, the Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. The
 $225.0 million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuring
 results primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within the
 Company, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities
 (including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and
 warehouses from 61 to 18), the elimination of over 6,000 positions (including
 3,300 from the divestiture of non-core businesses described below and
 approximately 2,800 other positions), the centralization of the Company's
 procurement function and re-negotiation of supply contracts resulting in
 procurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished products
 and the reduction of the Company's product offerings and stock keeping units
 ("SKU's"). The restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of the
 Company's core product categories and the elimination of those businesses and
 product lines that did not fit the core categories. Sunbeam's core product
 categories are Appliances, Health at Home, Personal Care and Comfort, Outdoor
 Cooking and Away From Home. Product categories and businesses determined to be
 non-core were divested in 1997, including the Company's furniture business and
 its time and temperature, decorative bedding and Counselor/registered trademark/
 and Borg/registered trademark/ scale product lines. In addition, the Company
 sold its textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in 1997.
 
 
      Net sales from continuing operations for 1997 were $1,168.2 million, an
 increase of $183.9 million or 18.7% over 1996. Net sales on a normalized basis,
 after excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued
 operations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding and
 Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ branded scales),
 increased 22.4% during the year.
 
 
      Global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during 1997 in all five of
 the Company's product categories primarily from new product introductions,
 improved distribution (particularly with the Company's top ten customers),
 international geographic expansion and improved price realization for certain
 products. Global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded 25% in the
 Appliance, Outdoor Cooking and Away From Home categories with sales increases
 of 26.8%, 27.2% and 28.6%, respectively. Sales in the Health at Home category
 increased 10.7% on a normalized basis and sales in the Personal Care and
 Comfort category increased 3.4% during 1997.
 
 
      The Company's Appliance category sales increases were driven by new
 products, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep
 fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass
 retailers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking products increased in 1997 after three
 straight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising and
 advertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely new
 line of grills and accessories for the 1998 season that began to ship in the
 fourth quarter of 1997 under a new "early buy" marketing program that included
 among other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarter
 of 1998. The Company sold approximately $50.0 million of Outdoor Cooking
 Products under this program in the fourth quarter of 1997. The early buy program
 for Outdoor Cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels and
 production efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distribution
 activities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and to
 drive additional retail sell-through of Outdoor Cooking products by reducing the
 likelihood of retail stock-outs during the important first and second quarter
 1998 selling season.
 
 
      Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products were up over 30% through
 September 1997, but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lower
 than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets
 in late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen
 sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. The Company anticipates
 shifting to a more
 
 
                                        14
 <PAGE>
 
 level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the
 seasonal demand for bedding products. Health at Home category sales increased
 as a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels.
 Away from Home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, including
 cordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution of
 commercially rated appliances. Also contributing to the Company's sales growth
 in 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of
 1997.
 
 
      International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew
 31.2% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220
 volt product introductions and the execution of 25 new international
 distribution and license agreements. Revenue growth of approximately 34% was
 achieved both in Mexico and by the Company's Latin American export sales
 organization, and sales in Venezuela and Canada increased approximately 23%
 each. European sales fell slightly in 1997, however the Company expects that
 expanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additional
 new distribution agreements will benefit European sales in 1998.
 
 
      The gross margin percentage for 1997 increased 19.8 percentage points to
 28.3%. This increase reflects the results of many cost savings and margin
 enhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the Company's restructuring plan
 coupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higher
 revenues associated with the Company's growth plan. The Company initiated a
 manufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of 1997 targeted at
 aggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations,
 including the Neosho, Missouri Outdoor Cooking Products facility which suffered
 from poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the 1997 grill
 season. The benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impact
 factory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of 1997. The
 refinement of the Neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiation
 of production for the 1998 grill season in the fourth quarter, included a
 revised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common parts
 in the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increase
 capacity and throughput.
 
 
      Operating earnings for 1997 were $199.4 million, an increase of $195.0
 million over 1996, excluding the impact of the 1996 special charge. As a
 percentage of sales, the operating margin of 17.1% increased 16.6 percentage
 points above last year's operating margin, excluding 1996 special charges. The
 operating margin improvements for 1997 were the result of the improved gross
 margin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A")
 costs in 1997 associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regional
 headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations
 center, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative and
 distribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company
 wide cost control initiatives. In addition, SG&A during 1996 included
 incremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and
 other costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higher
 than normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiatives
 related to the launch of the Company's growth plan, and higher bad debt
 expenses associated with certain of the Company's customers. The cost reduction
 initiatives and one time items in 1996 coupled with increased sales in 1997
 resulted in SG&A decreasing as a percentage of sales from 17.4% in 1996
 (excluding the impact of special charges) to 11.2% for 1997.
 
 
      Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in
 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997 due to
 improved cash flows.
 
 
      The effective income tax of 35% for 1997 and 1996 for earnings (loss) from
 continuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as a
 result of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits and
 loss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain state
 income tax credits.
 
 
      The Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was
 $1.41 per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of
 $2.37. The Company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share
 calculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an increase
 in the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
 outstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value of
 the Company's common stock in 1997.

      The Company's discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in March
 1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
 sale and break-even earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture operations
 had net income of $.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated
 loss on disposal of the business of $32.4 million, net of applicable income tax
 benefits. The sale of the Company's furniture business assets (primarily
 inventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March 1997.
 
 
      The Company received $69 million in cash and retained accounts receivable
 related to the furniture business of approximately $50.0 million as of the
 closing date. The final purchase price for the furniture business was subject
 to a post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement
 and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company
 recorded an additional loss on disposal of $13.7 million, net of income tax
 benefits. See discussion of Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in Note 8
 and Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale in Note 9 to the Company's
 consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the
 individual components of the 1996 special charge and details of the 1997
 activity in the Company's restructuring accrual.
 
 
 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
 
 
      The Company's operating results for 1996 include the effects of a pre-tax
 special charge of $337.6 million recorded in conjunction with the
 implementation of its restructuring and growth plan announced in November 1996.
 Approximately 20% of the charge was for cash items primarily for severance
 costs and lease and other facility exit costs. The special charge to earnings
 in 1996 is included in the following categories on the consolidated statement
 of operations (in millions):

 </TABLE>
 
      Net sales from continuing operations of $984.2 million for 1996 represents
 a decrease of $32.7 million, or 3.2%, from 1995. The Company experienced a loss
 from continuing operations of $196.7 million or $2.37 per share for 1996 versus
 earnings from continuing operations of $37.6 million or $.45 per share
 (diluted) in 1995 primarily as a result of the restructuring activities
 discussed above. The net loss for 1996 was $228.3 million, or $2.75 per share,
 compared to net earnings of $50.5 million, or $0.61 per share (diluted), for
 1995. Excluding the impact of special charge items for 1996, earnings from
 continuing operations before income taxes decreased from $60.6 million in 1995
 to a loss of $12.9 million in 1996.
 
 
      Domestic sales represented approximately 80% of total sales of the Company
 in 1996 and decreased $28.5 million or 3.4% from 1995. This sales decline was
 driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7.3% and
 lower sales of bedding products which declined 9.0% from 1995, primarily as
 result of lower decorative bedding sales (divested in December 1996). Domestic
 sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new products
 such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing on
 breadmakers. Sales of other product categories such as health and personal care
 products and time and temperature products (divested in March 1997) were either
 flat or declined slightly from 1995 levels.
 
 
      International sales decreased $4.2 million or 2.2% from 1995 primarily as
 a result of lower sales in Latin America due to political and/or economic
 instability in several countries such as Ecuador, Peru, Columbia and Venezuela
 (which suffered a bolivar devaluation in April 1996), a sales decline of 11.2%
 
 
                                        16
 <PAGE>
 
 in Canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the Company's then largest
 Canadian customer offset by a 55.0% increase in sales in Mexico as a result of
 a more stable economic environment in 1996.
 
 
      The Company's gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of special
 charges, was 17.9% of sales in 1996, down from 20.4% in 1995, primarily from
 the underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturing
 capacity that has been realigned for 1997 and beyond by the Company's
 restructuring and growth plan cost reduction initiatives.
 
 
      Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, excluding the
 impact of special charges described above, were 17.6% of sales in 1996
 primarily as a result of an inflated cost structure that has been realigned for
 1997 and beyond. In addition, a $12.0 million fourth quarter 1996 media
 advertising campaign and one-time expenditures for market research, new
 packaging, and other growth plan initiatives resulted in higher than normal
 SG&A spending in 1996. Also included in 1996 SG&A costs were $7.7 million of
 compensation expense resulting from restricted stock awards made in connection
 with the employment of a new senior management team.
 
 
      Interest expense for 1996 increased from $9.4 million in 1995 to $13.6
 million as a result of increased indebtedness of the Company for working
 capital requirements and non-recurring capitalized interest in 1995 related to
 the construction of the Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center.
 
 
      The effective income tax rate for 1996 decreased 3 percentage points from
 1995 to 35.0% as a result of certain foreign and state operating losses for
 which no tax benefits were recorded and the non-deductibility of compensation
 expense related to restricted stock awards.
 
 
      The Company's discontinued furniture operations had revenues of $227.5
 million in 1996, up 22.6% from $185.6 million in 1995. This revenue growth was
 the result of the acquisition of the Samsonite/registered trademark/ furniture
 business in November 1995. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniture
 business sales declined 2.1%. Earnings from the discontinued furniture
 operations, net of taxes, declined from $12.9 million in 1995 to $.8 million in
 1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,
 underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. In
 addition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsonite/registered
 trademark/ furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,
 particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses.
 
 
 FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
 
      During 1997 approximately 90% of the Company's business was conducted in
 U.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export
 sales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority
 of European sales). The Company's exposure to market risk from changes in
 foreign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company's
 non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in
 Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary
 economy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and Mexico reverted to
 hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translation
 adjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets are included
 as a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments were not material
 to 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results.
 
 
      On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
 exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures
 that arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are
 entered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did
 not have a material impact on the Company's financial results in 1995, 1996 and
 1997. See Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 
      As of December 28, 1997, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
 $52.4 million and total debt of $195.2 million. Cash used in operating
 activities during 1997 was $8.2 million compared to $14.2
 
 
                                        17
 <PAGE>
 
 million provided by operating activities in 1996. This decrease is primarily
 attributable to an increase in earnings before non-cash charges in 1997 and the
 utilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the Company's
 restructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased sales
 in 1997 and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in 1997
 necessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the Company's
 initiatives to improve customer service levels and 1997 cash expenditures
 required to implement the restructuring plan. In addition, cash used in
 operating activities reflects $59 million of proceeds from the sale of trade
 accounts receivable under the Company's revolving trade accounts receivable
 securitization program entered into in December 1997 as more fully described in
 Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
 
      Capital spending totaled $58.3 million in 1997 and was primarily for new
 products, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. Capital spending
 in 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5 million related to the discontinued
 furniture operations) and was primarily attributable to new product
 development, cost reduction initiatives and a $5.0 million warehouse expansion
 financed with a capital lease. Capital spending in 1995 reflected approximately
 $59.4 million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, $27.4 million related
 to new product development and $10.8 million attributable to the discontinued
 furniture business. The remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost
 reduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance
 including $14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cooking
 products. The Company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5%
 of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions
 and certain facility rationalization initiatives.
 
 
      Cash provided by investing activities also reflects $91.0 million in
 proceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined to
 be non-core to the Company's ongoing operations in conjunction with the 1996
 restructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes the
 purchase of a portion of the Company's furniture business, which was
 subsequently divested in full in March 1997.
 
 
      Cash provided by financing activities totaled $16.4 million in 1997 and
 reflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company's revolving credit
 facility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture
 operations and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash proceeds from the
 exercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the
 Company. In 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million was
 primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to support
 working capital and capital spending requirements, $11.5 million in new
 issuances of long-term debt and $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of
 treasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In July 1997, the Company
 reduced the amount of available borrowings under its September 1996 unsecured
 five year revolving credit facility from $500 million to $250 million.
 
 
      The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantially
 all related to previously divested operations. In connection with the Company's
 restructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures was
 undertaken and the Company accelerated its strategy for the resolution and
 settlement of certain environmental claims. This review and change in strategy
 resulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more
 fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. In
 management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters
 will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.
 
 
      On March 2, 1998, the Company announced the signing of definitive
 agreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA, Inc. and
 First Alert, Inc. Completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in the
 second quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, including
 regulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. In connection with the
 acquisitions, the Company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt of
 the acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existing
 long-term debt. The Company expects to finance the cash portion of the
 acquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolving
 and term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrent
 with the acquisition closings. Refer to Note 14 for additional information
 regarding the pending acquisitions.
 
 
      The Company believes its cash flow from operations, existing cash and cash
 equivalent balances, its receivable securitization program, with the proceeds of
 the anticipated new debt financings discussed above will be sufficient to
 support working capital needs, capital spending, debt service and acquisition
 related cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
