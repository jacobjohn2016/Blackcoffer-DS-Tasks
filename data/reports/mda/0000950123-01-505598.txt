                     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 OVERVIEW
 
 AT&T Corp. (AT&T) is among the world's communications leaders, providing voice,
 data, video and broadband telecommunications services to large and small
 businesses, consumers and government agencies. We provide domestic and
 international long distance; regional and local communications services; cable
 television and Internet communications services. We also provide directory and
 calling-card services to support our communications business.
 
 TRACKING STOCKS
 
 A tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to its holders based
 on the financial performance and economic value of the assets it tracks.
 Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock, AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock or
 Liberty Media Class A or B tracking stock did not represent a direct legal
 interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but an ownership of
 AT&T in total. The specific shares represented an interest in the economic
 performance of the net assets of each of the groups.
 
 AT&T Wireless Group was an integrated business of AT&T and Liberty Media Group
 was a combination of certain assets and businesses of AT&T, neither of which was
 a stand-alone entity at June 30, 2001. Subsequent to June 30, 2001, both of
 these groups have been split-off from AT&T.
 
 
 RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T
 
 On October 25, 2000, AT&T announced a restructuring plan designed to fully
 separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect the financial
 performance and economic value of each of AT&T's four major operating units. If
 the plan is completed as announced, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband, AT&T Business
 and AT&T Consumer would all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.
 
 On July 8, 2001, Comcast Corp. (Comcast) made an unsolicited offer to acquire
 AT&T Broadband. On July 18, AT&T's Board of Directors unanimously voted to
 reject Comcast's proposal to acquire AT&T Broadband. The Board has directed
 management to explore financial and strategic alternatives relating to AT&T
 Broadband, including the previously announced restructuring plans, with the goal
 to provide the greatest long-term value to shareowners. The Board also decided
 to delay finalizing and mailing to shareowners the proxy materials, filed
 preliminary with the SEC on July 3, 2001, for its current restructuring plans.
 However, AT&T remains committed to separate AT&T Consumer and AT&T Business from
 AT&T Broadband and to create a separate tracking stock designed to represent the
 financial performance of AT&T Consumer.
 
 On May 25, 2001, AT&T completed an exchange offer of AT&T common stock for AT&T
 Wireless stock. Under the terms of the exchange offer, AT&T issued 1.176 shares
 of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock in exchange for each share of AT&T common
 stock validly tendered. A total of 372.2 million shares of AT&T common stock
 were tendered in exchange for 437.7 million shares of AT&T Wireless Group
 tracking stock.
 
 On July 9, 2001, AT&T completed the split-off of AT&T Wireless as a separate,
 independently-traded company. All AT&T Wireless tracking stock was converted
 into AT&T Wireless common stock on a one-for-one basis and 1,136 million shares
 of AT&T Wireless common stock, held by AT&T, were distributed to AT&T common
 shareowners on a basis of 0.3218 of a share of AT&T Wireless for each AT&T share
 outstanding. AT&T common shareowners received whole shares of AT&T Wireless and
 cash payments for fractional shares. The Internal Revenue
 
 <PAGE>   35
 Service (IRS) ruled that the transaction qualified as tax-free for AT&T and its
 shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with the exception of cash
 received for fractional shares. AT&T retained approximately $3 billion, or 7.3%,
 of AT&T Wireless common stock, about half of which was used in a debt-for-equity
 exchange in July. The remaining shares will be sold, exchanged or monetized
 within the next six months. AT&T Wireless will continue trading on the New York
 Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "AWE".
 
 On August 10, 2001, AT&T completed the split-off of Liberty Media Corporation as
 an independent, publicly-traded company. AT&T redeemed each outstanding share of
 Class A and Class B Liberty Media Group (LMG) tracking stock for one share of
 Liberty Media Corporation's Series A and Series B common stock, respectively. In
 the redemption, shares of Liberty Media Corporation were issued to former
 holders of Liberty Media Group tracking stock in exchange for their shares of
 Liberty Media Group tracking stock. The IRS ruled that the split-off of Liberty
 Media Corporation qualified as a tax-free transaction for AT&T, Liberty Media
 and their shareowners. Liberty Media Corporation's Series A common stock and
 Series B common stock is now listed on the NYSE under the symbols "LMC.A" and
 "LMC.B", respectively.
 
 AT&T's restructuring plan is complicated and involves a substantial number of
 steps and transactions, including obtaining various conditions, such as Internal
 Revenue Service rulings. AT&T expects that the transactions associated with
 AT&T's restructuring plan will be tax-free to U.S. shareowners. In addition,
 future financial conditions, superior alternatives or other factors may arise or
 occur that make it inadvisable to proceed with part or all of AT&T's
 restructuring plans. Any or all of the elements of AT&T's restructuring plan may
 not occur as we currently expect or in the time frames that we currently
 contemplate, or at all. Alternative forms of restructuring, including sales of
 interests in these businesses, would reduce what is available for distribution
 to shareowners in the restructuring.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
 This document may contain forward-looking statements with respect to AT&T's
 restructuring plan, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,
 dividends, financing plans, business strategies, operating efficiencies or
 synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, network build out and
 upgrade, competitive positions, availability of capital, growth opportunities
 for existing products, benefits from new technologies, availability and
 deployment of new technologies, plans and objectives of management, and other
 matters.
 
 These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating
 to the future business prospects, revenue, working capital, liquidity, capital
 needs, network build out, interest costs and income, are necessarily estimates
 reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number of risks
 and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
 those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
 statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important
 factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
 projections contained in the forward-looking statements including, without
 limitation:
 
 - -   the risks associated with the implementation of AT&T's restructuring plan,
     which is complicated and involves a substantial number of different
     transactions each with separate conditions, any or all of which may not
     occur as we currently intend, or which may not occur in the timeframe we
     currently expect,
 
 - -   the risks associated with each of AT&T's main business units, operating as
     independent entities as opposed to as part of an integrated
     telecommunications provider following completion of AT&T's restructuring
     plan, including the inability of these groups to rely on the financial and
     operational resources of the combined company and these groups having to
     provide services that were previously provided by a different part of the
     combined company,
 
 - -   the impact of existing and new competitors in the markets in which these
     groups compete, including competitors that may offer less expensive products
     and services, desirable or innovative products, technological substitutes,
     or have extensive resources or better financing,
 
 - -   the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting from excessive deployment of
     network capacity,
 
 - -   the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in the
     telecommunications industry, which may have the effect of making the
     competitors of these entities larger and better financed and afford these
     competitors with extensive resources and greater geographic reach, allowing
     them to compete more effectively,
 
 - -   the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which the company
     operates, which may decrease prices charged, increase churn and change
     customer mix, profitability and average revenue per user,
 
 - -   the ability to establish a significant market presence in new geographic and
     service markets,
 
 - -   the availability and cost of capital and the consequences of increased
     leverage,
 
 - -   the successful execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic assets as part
     of an overall corporate deleveraging plan,
 
 <PAGE>   37
 
 - -   the impact of any unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of the
     business strategies of the company,
 
 - -   the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to competitors
     by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or state regulatory
     commissions under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or other applicable
     laws and regulations,
 
 - -   the risks associated with technological requirements, technology
     substitution and changes and other technological developments,
 
 - -   the results of litigation filed or to be filed against the company,
 
 - -   the possibility of one or more of the markets in which the company competes
     being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors, such as
     monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over
     which these groups have no control, and
 
 - -   the risks related to AT&T's joint ventures.
 
 The words "estimate," "project," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan" and
 similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Readers
 are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
 which speak only as of the date of this document. Moreover, in the future, AT&T,

 The discussion and analysis that follows provides information management
 believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of AT&T's consolidated
 results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,
 and financial condition as of June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 The comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2001 results with the
 corresponding periods in 2000 was impacted by events, such as acquisitions and
 dispositions, that occurred during these two years. For example, on June 15,
 2000, we acquired MediaOne, which was included in our second quarter and
 year-to-date 2001 results, but was only included in our prior year results since
 date of acquisition.
 
 Year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of At Home
 Corporation (Excite@Home) beginning September 1, 2000, due to
 corporate-governance changes, which gave AT&T a controlling interest. On June
 30, 2001, we had an approximate 23% economic interest and 74% voting interest in
 Excite@Home. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusion of 100%
 of its results in each line item of AT&T's Consolidated Balance Sheet and
 Consolidated Statement of Operations. The approximate 77% we do not own is
 reflected within "Minority Interest" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as a
 component of "Minority interest income (expense)" in the Consolidated Statement
 of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001. For the three
 and six months ended June 30, 2000, our ownership interest in Excite@Home was
 accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with earnings or losses
 included as a component of "Net losses from other equity investments" in the
 Consolidated Statement of Operations.
 
 Effective July 1, 2000, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) eliminated
 Primary Interexchange Carrier Charges (PICC or per-line charges) that AT&T pays
 for residential and single-line businesses. The elimination of these per-line
 charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue, since AT&T
 has historically billed its customers for these charges.

 </TABLE>
 
 Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2001 decreased 3.0%, or $0.4
 billion, compared with the corresponding prior year period. The decline was
 primarily driven by lower revenue resulting from accelerating declines in long
 distance voice revenue. Partially offsetting the decrease was revenue of
 approximately $0.4 billion due to the net impact of acquisitions, the
 consolidation of Excite@Home, the elimination of PICC and dispositions. Also
 offsetting the decline was growth from new services at AT&T Broadband and data
 and Internet protocol (IP) within AT&T Business.
 
 Total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2001 decreased 2.1%, or $0.6
 billion, compared with the corresponding prior year period. The decline was
 primarily driven by accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue.
 Partially offsetting the decline was revenue of approximately $0.9 billion due
 to the net impact of acquisitions, the consolidation of Excite@Home, the
 elimination of PICC and dispositions. Also offsetting the decline was growth
 from data and Internet protocol (IP) within AT&T Business and new services at
 AT&T Broadband.
 
 
 We expect long distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing
 competition and product substitution.

 Costs of services and products increased $0.4 billion, or 13.3%, in the second
 quarter of 2001 compared with the second quarter of 2000 primarily due to our
 acquisition of MediaOne and the consolidation of Excite@Home.
 
 Costs of services and products increased $1.0 billion, or 17.0%, for the first
 half of 2001 compared with the first half of 2000. Approximately $1.0 billion of
 the increase was driven by net acquisitions, primarily MediaOne, and the impact
 of consolidating Excite@Home. Also contributing to the increase was higher costs
 associated with our growth businesses, primarily in our outsourcing and
 broadband business, of approximately $0.2 billion, partially offset by $0.2
 billion of our cost reduction efforts, lower costs associated with lower volumes
 from our international ventures and lower payphone compensation cost.

 </TABLE>
 
 Access and other connection expenses decreased 12.0% in second quarter of 2001
 compared with second quarter of 2000. Approximately $0.5 billion of the decrease
 was due to decreased per-line charges or PICC and mandated reductions in
 per-minute access costs. Effective July 1, 2000, per-line charges that AT&T paid
 for residential and single-line business customers were eliminated by the
 Federal Communications Commission. These decreases were partially offset by $0.1
 billion of higher costs due to volume increases.
 
 Access and other connection expenses decreased 11.0% for the six months ended
 June 30, 2001, compared with the same period in 2000. Mandated reductions in
 per-minute access costs and decreased per-line charges effective in the second
 half of 2000 resulted in lower costs of $0.9 billion. These decreases were
 partially offset by higher costs of $0.2 billion due to volume increases and
 $0.1 billion as a result of higher Universal Service Fund contributions.

 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $0.5 billion, or
 19.2%, in the second quarter of 2001, compared with the second quarter of 2000.
 Approximately $0.1 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions, primarily
 MediaOne and the consolidation of Excite@Home. Costs associated with AT&T's
 restructuring plan, combined with a lower pension credit resulting from
 decreased return on plan assets accounted for approximately $0.2 billion of the
 increase. Increased sales, marketing, advertising and customer care in support
 of growth businesses within AT&T Broadband and AT&T Business drove approximately
 $0.2 billion of the increase. Partially offsetting these increases were lower
 costs associated with the impact of decreased volume and cost control efforts of
 approximately $0.1 billion from AT&T Consumer.

 acquisitions, primarily MediaOne and the consolidation of Excite@Home. Increased
 sales, marketing, advertising and customer care in support of growth businesses
 within AT&T Broadband and AT&T Business drove approximately $0.4 billion of the

 in the second quarter of 2001 compared with the corresponding prior year period
 and increased $0.8 billion, or 30.3%, for the first half of 2001 compared with
 the first half of 2000. For both periods, approximately one-half of the increase
 was due to the acquisition of MediaOne. The remaining increase was largely due
 to a higher asset base primarily resulting from continued infrastructure
 investment, as well as the consolidation of Excite@Home. Capital expenditures
 were $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, for the three months ended
 June 30, 2001 and 2000 and were $4.3 billion for each of the first six months of
 2001 and 2000. The primary focus of capital spending in both years continues to
 be on the growth areas of broadband, data and IP, and local.

 </TABLE>
 
 During the second quarter of 2001, AT&T recorded $287 million of net
 restructuring and other charges. Included in these charges were $56 million of
 asset impairment charges related to Excite@Home including the write-off of
 property, plant and equipment, and $231 million for restructuring and exits
 costs, which consisted of $88 of million for severance costs, $136 million
 related to facility closings and $7 million primarily related to termination of
 contractual obligations.
 
 The severance costs, for approximately 4,500 employees, primarily resulted from
 synergies created by the MediaOne merger. Approximately 27% of the affected
 employees are management employees and 73% are non-management employees.
 
 Net restructuring and other charges for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
 totaled $1,095 million. The charge includes $795 million of asset impairment
 charges related to Excite@Home, $300 million for restructuring and exit costs
 which consisted of $147 million for severance costs, $142 million for facilities
 closing and $11 million primarily related to termination of contractual
 obligations.
 
 The asset impairment charges included $600 million recorded by Excite@Home
 associated with goodwill impairment of various acquisitions, primarily Excite,
 and a related goodwill impairment charge of $139 million recorded by AT&T
 associated with its acquisition goodwill of Excite@Home. The impairment resulted
 from the continued weakness of the online media market that Excite@Home operates
 in. Since we consolidate, but only own approximately 23% of Excite@Home, 77% of
 the charge recorded by Excite@Home was not included as a reduction to AT&T's net
 income, but rather eliminated in our June 30, 2001 Consolidated Statement of
 Operations as a component of "Minority interest income (expense)." In the second
 quarter of 2001, Excite@Home recorded an additional $56 million of asset
 impairment charges related to the write-off of property, plant and equipment.
 
 The severance costs, for approximately 6,900 employees, primarily resulted from
 synergies created by the MediaOne merger. Approximately 21% of the affected
 employees are management employees and 79% are non-management employees.
 
 
 <PAGE>   42
 This restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of
 approximately $93 million in 2001 (net of severance benefit pay-outs of
 approximately $147 million) and approximately $340 million per year thereafter.
 The initiative will yield no EBIT savings, net of restructuring charges in 2001,
 and is projected to yield approximately $340 million per year thereafter. We
 expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cash
 and EBIT savings. The EBIT savings, primarily attributable to reduced
 personnel-related expenses, will be realized in costs of services and products
 and SG&A expenses.
 
 During the six months ended June 30, 2000, AT&T recorded $773 million of net
 restructuring and other charges, which included $682 million for restructuring
 and exit costs associated with AT&T's initiative to reduce costs by the end of
 2000, and $91 million related to the government-mandated disposition of AT&T
 Communications (U.K.) Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert.
 
 Included in restructuring and exit costs was $458 million of cash termination
 benefits associated with the involuntary separation of approximately 6,200
 employees. Approximately one-half of the individuals were management employees
 and one-half were non-management employees.
 
 We also recorded $62 million of network lease and other contract termination
 costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying vendors of the
 termination of these contracts during the first quarter 2000.
 
 Also included in restructuring and exit costs was $144 million of benefit
 curtailment costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit
 plans. We also recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 million related to the
 write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain businesses in which the carrying
 value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.

 Operating income decreased $1.8 billion, or 56.6%, in the second quarter of 2001
 compared with the second quarter of 2000. Operating income decreased $3.3
 billion, or 60.3%, for the first half of 2001 compared with the first half of
 2000. Approximately $0.5 billion of the second quarter decrease and
 approximately one-half of the year-to-date decrease was due to the acquisition
 of MediaOne and the consolidation of Excite@Home, including the impact of
 restructuring and other charges. The remaining decrease reflects the impact of
 the declining long distance voice business and spending in growth areas, which
 has resulted in lower revenue and higher expenses. In addition, the year-to-date
 decrease was partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges. A
 majority of the impact of the operating loss generated by Excite@Home was offset
 in minority interest income (expense), reflecting the approximate 77% of
 Excite@Home we do not own.

 Other income (expense) for the second quarter of 2001 was an expense of $1.4
 billion, an increase in expense of $1.8 billion from the second quarter of 2000.
 The increase in expense was primarily driven by an impairment charge of
 approximately $1.1 billion due to a pretax write-down to market of our
 investment in Net2Phone and a $0.8 billion loss on the Excite@Home put
 
 <PAGE>   43
 obligation settlement with Cox Communications (Cox), Inc. and Comcast partially
 offset by higher net gains on the sales of businesses and investments of $0.3
 billion. Net gains in 2001 included a gain on the sale of our stake in Japan
 Telecom of approximately $0.5 billion, a gain on the sale of an entity owning
 Baltimore cable-systems to Comcast of approximately $0.1 billion and a loss on
 the redemption of AT&T stock held by Comcast in exchange for an entity owning
 cable-systems of approximately $0.3 billion.
 
 Other income (expense) for the first half of 2001 was an expense of $2.2
 billion, an increase in expense of $3.2 billion compared with the same period in
 2000. The higher expense was in part driven by impairment charges of
 approximately $1.3 billion primarily relating to our investment in Net2Phone. In
 addition, effective January 1, 2001, in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS
 No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", we
 reclassified certain investment securities, which support debt that is indexed
 to those securities, from "available-for-sale" to "trading." As a result, we
 recorded a pretax charge of $0.9 billion in other income reflecting the initial
 reclassification impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as well as the ongoing
 investment and derivative revaluation. Also contributing to the higher expense
 was a $0.8 billion loss on the Excite@Home put obligation settlement with Cox
 and Comcast, and $0.1 billion of lower net gains on the sale of businesses and
 investments.

 compared with the same period in 2000. Interest expense increased 48.5%, or $0.5
 billion, for the six months ended June 30, 2001, compared with the same period
 in 2000. The increase in both periods was largely due to the higher average debt
 balance primarily as a result of our June 2000 acquisition of MediaOne,
 including outstanding debt of MediaOne and debt issued to fund the MediaOne
 acquisition. The impact of MediaOne was partially offset by the Company's debt
 reduction efforts in 2001.

 The provision for income taxes decreased $2.0 billion, or 179.6%, to a benefit
 of $0.9 billion in the second quarter of 2001 compared with a provision of $1.1
 billion in the second quarter of 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a net
 loss before income taxes in second quarter of 2001, compared with earnings
 before income taxes in the second quarter of 2000. The effective tax rate for
 the second quarter of 2001 was 103.3%, compared with 37.5% for the prior year
 second quarter. The second quarter effective tax benefit rate increased
 primarily due to the net tax benefits resulting from the Excite@Home put
 obligation settlement with Cox and Comcast and the redemption of AT&T stock held
 by Comcast in exchange for certain cable systems. These impacts were partially
 offset by the consolidation of operational loss of Excite@Home, for which the
 company is unable to record tax benefits, and higher non tax-deductible goodwill
 amortization versus the second quarter of 2000.
 
 The provision for income taxes decreased $2.2 billion, or 141.0%, to a benefit
 of $0.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2001 compared with a provision
 of $1.6 billion for the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a
 net loss before income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2001, compared
 with earnings before income taxes for the same prior year period. The effective
 tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2001 was 38.6%, compared with 29.6%
 for the same period in 2000. The 2001 effective tax benefit rate increased
 primarily due to the net tax benefits resulting from the Excite@Home put
 obligation settlement with Cox and Comcast and the redemption of AT&T stock held
 by Comcast in exchange for certain cable systems. These impacts were partially
 offset by a non tax-deductible asset impairment charge recorded by Excite@Home,
 the consolidation of operational loss of Excite@Home, for which the company is
 unable to record tax benefits and higher non tax-deductible goodwill
 amortization. The 2000 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax-free
 gain resulting from an exchange of AT&T stock for an entity owning certain cable
 systems and other assets with Cox and the benefit of the write-off of the
 related deferred tax liability.

 Minority interest income (expense), which is recorded net of income taxes,
 represents an adjustment to AT&T's income to reflect the less than 100%
 ownership of consolidated subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
 issued by subsidiaries of AT&T. The Company recorded $0.2 billion of minority
 interest income in the second quarter of 2001 and $46 million of minority
 interest expense in the second quarter of 2000. Minority interest income
 (expense) was $0.8 billion of income for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and
 $92 million of minority interest expense for the six months ended June 30,
 2000. The increase in both periods is primarily due to the consolidation of
 Excite@Home effective September 1, 2000. The minority interest income in 2001
 primarily reflects loss generated by Excite@Home, including business
 restructuring and asset impairment charges, that were attributable to the
 approximate 77% of Excite@Home not owned by AT&T. The income tax benefit
 recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $7 million and $31 million
 for the second quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The income tax benefit
 recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $87 million and $59 million
 for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000, respectively.

 Equity losses from Liberty Media Group (LMG), which is recorded net of income
 taxes, increased $2.4 billion for the three months and $4.0 billion for the six
 months ended June 30, 2001 compared with the same periods in 2000. The higher
 losses were primarily driven by higher losses of affiliates, lower gains on
 dispositions and higher unrealized loss on financial instruments.

 Net losses from other equity investments, recorded net of income taxes, were
 $0.3 billion in the second quarter of 2001, a 47.4% increase compared with the
 prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to the higher equity loss
 from Concert, partially offset by the consolidation of Excite@Home. The income
 tax benefit recorded on net losses from other equity investments was $91 million
 and $122 million for the second quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Also
 included in this line is amortization of goodwill associated with
 nonconsolidated investments recorded as a reduction of income. This totaled $76
 million and $110 million for the second quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.
 
 Net losses from other equity investments were $0.3 billion for the six months
 ended June 30, 2001, a decrease of $58 million, or 14.9%, compared with the same
 period of 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of
 Excite@Home, the higher earnings related to Cablevision Systems Corp. reflecting
 a gain associated with the swap of cable properties. Partially offsetting these
 decreases was a higher equity loss from Concert. The income tax benefit recorded
 on net losses from other equity investments was $166 million and $267 million
 for the first half of 2001 and the first half of 2000, respectively.
 Amortization of goodwill associated with nonconsolidated investments recorded as
 a reduction of income. This totaled $156 million and $225 million for the first
 six months of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, was $0.4
 billion, for the six months ended June 30, 2001 for AT&T Group. It represented
 fair value adjustments of debt instruments including those acquired in
 conjunction with the MediaOne merger, as well as to our warrant portfolio due to
 the adoption of SFAS No. 133. In addition, we also reclassified certain
 investment securities, which support debt that is indexed to those securities,
 from "available-for-sale" to "trading."
 
 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, was $0.5

 Dividend requirements of preferred stock were $0.2 billion in the second quarter

 stock issued to NTT DoCoMo in January of 2001 as well as accretion of the
 beneficial conversion feature. On July 9, 2001, in conjunction with the
 split-off of AT&T Wireless Group, these preferred shares were converted into
 AT&T Wireless common stock. As a result, we will recognize, in the third
 quarter, the remaining unamortized beneficial conversion feature balance of $0.2
 billion.

 The loss from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to the AT&T
 Common Stock Group was $0.10 in the second quarter of 2001 compared with
 earnings per share (EPS) on a diluted basis of $0.48 in the first quarter of
 2000. The year over year loss was primarily driven by lower operating income, an
 impairment charge reflecting an other than temporary decline on our investment
 in Net2Phone, dividends on NTT DoCoMo preferred stock and increased interest
 expense, partially offset by a gain on the sale of Japan Telecom and higher
 minority interest income.
 
 The loss from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to the AT&T
 Common Stock Group was $0.28 for the six months ended June 30, 2001 compared
 with earnings per diluted share of $1.01 for the six months ended June 30, 2000.
 The year over year loss was primarily driven by lower operating income, an
 impairment charge reflecting an other than temporary decline on our investment
 in Net2Phone, a charge relating to the initial reclassification impact of the
 adoption of SFAS 133 which revalued certain securities reclassified from
 "available-for-sale" to "trading", lower gains on the sales of businesses and
 investments, dividends on NTT DoCoMo preferred stock and
 
 <PAGE>   47
 increased interest expense, partially offset by higher minority interest income.
 
 The Consolidated Financial Statements of AT&T have been restated to reflect AT&T
 Wireless as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the revenue, costs and

 Consolidated Statements of Operations, and have been reported as "Income from
 discontinued operations" for all periods presented. Earnings from discontinued
 operations per diluted share attributable to the AT&T Common Stock Group were
 $0.05 for the second quarters of 2001 and 2000, and were $0.03 and $0.06 for the
 six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
 
 Earnings per share attributable to AT&T Wireless Group were $0.08 in the second
 quarter of 2001 and $0.06 from April 27, 2000, date of the initial public
 offering through June 30, 2000.
 
 The loss per diluted share attributable to Liberty Media Group (LMG) was $0.82
 in the second quarter of 2001, compared with earnings of $0.10 in the second
 quarter of 2000. The loss per diluted share attributable to Liberty Media Group
 (LMG) was $0.88 for the first half of 2001, compared with earnings of $0.47 in
 the first half of 2000. The higher loss for both periods was primarily driven by
 higher losses of affiliates, lower gains on dispositions and unrealized losses
 on financial instruments.
 
 
 
 SEGMENT RESULTS
 
 In support of the services we provide, we segment our results by the business
 units that support our primary lines of business: AT&T Business, AT&T Consumer
 and AT&T Broadband. The balance of AT&T's continuing operations, excluding LMG
 is included in a Corporate and Other category. Although not a segment, we also
 discuss the results of LMG.
 
 The discussion of segment results includes revenue; EBIT (earnings before
 interest, taxes, the cumulative effect of an accounting change, dividend
 requirements of preferred stock, the premium on the Wireless exchange and
 discontinued operations); EBITDA (EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization,
 and minority interest (expense) income other than Excite@Home's minority
 interest (expense) income); total assets, and capital additions. The discussion
 of EBITDA for AT&T Broadband is modified to exclude other income and net losses
 from equity investments. Total assets for each segment includes all assets,
 except intercompany receivables. Prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or
 leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level, and therefore are
 included in the Corporate and Other group. Capital additions for each segment
 include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, additions to
 nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs and additions to
 internal-use software.
 
 EBIT is the primary measure used by AT&T's chief operating decision makers to
 measure AT&T's operating results and to measure segment profitability and
 performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as operating (loss) income plus net pretax
 losses from equity investments, pretax minority interest income (expense) and
 other income. In addition, management also uses EBITDA as a measure of segment
 profitability and performance, and is defined as EBIT, excluding minority
 interest (expense) income other than Excite@Home's minority interest (expense)
 income, plus depreciation and amortization. Interest and taxes are not factored
 into the segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision
 makers; therefore, trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis.
 Management believes EBIT and EBITDA are meaningful to investors because they
 provide analysis of operating results using the same measures used by AT&T's
 chief operating decision makers. In addition, we believe that both EBIT and
 EBITDA allow investors a mean to evaluate the financial results of each segment
 in relation to total AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was deficit of $260 million and earning
 of $3,099 million, and EBITDA was $2,162 million and $4,997 million for the
 three months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,
 <PAGE>   48
 respectively. EBIT was $199 million and $5,669 million, and EBITDA was $5,052
 million and $9,327 million for the first half of 2001 and 2000, respectively.
 Our calculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the
 calculation of these measures by other public companies. EBIT and EBITDA should
 not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting
 principles (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash
 flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
 liquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain
 assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow.
 
 In connection with our corporate restructuring program set forth in late 2000,
 our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes since the publication
 of our 2000 annual results. The changes are as follows: AT&T Business was
 expanded to include the results of international operations and ventures. In
 addition, certain corporate costs that were previously recorded within the
 Corporate and Other Group have been allocated to the respective segments in an
 effort to ultimately have the results of these businesses reflect all direct
 corporate costs as well as overhead for shared services. All prior period
 results have been restated to reflect these changes.
 
 Reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continuously review our management
 model and structure, which may result in additional adjustments to our operating
 segments in the future. In addition, when we create tracking stock for other
 units, we will begin allocating `pure' corporate overhead as appropriate. See
 note (b) for further detail on our restructuring plan.
